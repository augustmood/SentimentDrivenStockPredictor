**1. The Fundamentals are Screaming ""Buy""**

Pure Storage, folks, isn't your average Joe's data storage company. In an era where data is the new oil, PSTG is sitting on a gold mine with its innovative data solutions and flash storage tech. Their financials? Stronger than a garlic martini. With consistent revenue growth year-over-year and a clientele that includes some of the biggest names in tech, healthcare, and finance, PSTG is not just walking the walk; it's moonwalking.

**2. Technical Analysis: The Stars Align**

Let's break down the technicals, where the charts whisper secrets to those who dare listen:

- **Bullish Patterns Galore:** PSTG has been painting the town red with bullish patterns. A recent breakout from a cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart suggests a potential upward trajectory. For the uninitiated, this is like seeing a double rainbow with a pot of gold at both ends.

- **Moving Averages are Your Friend:** The 50-day moving average recently crossed above the 200-day moving average, a golden cross, signaling a bull market on the horizon. It's like the market's way of giving us the nod.

- **Volume Speaks Volumes:** An uptick in trading volume accompanies the breakout, confirming the bulls are in town, and they're not here for the tapas. They're here for the whole feast.

**3. Industry Tailwinds Like a Category 5 Hurricane**

Data is growing at an exponential rate, and with the advent of AI, IoT, and 5G, the demand for efficient, reliable storage solutions is skyrocketing. PSTG is at the forefront of this revolution, with products that outperform the competition on speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight.

$PSTG (Pure Storage) stands at the vanguard of revolutionizing how the world stores and accesses data, through their cutting-edge ""disruptive storage"" solutions. In an era where data generation and consumption are skyrocketing, their innovative approach to flash storage technology is not just about storing bytes; it's about redefining speed, efficiency, and reliability in data access. By dramatically reducing energy consumption and physical space needs, while simultaneously offering unparalleled data processing speeds, they‚Äôre creating ‚Äústorage-as-code‚Äù basically changing how we view data storage as a whole, re-writing how much Megabytes, and gigabytes can really hold. In a recent hardware change over, one of their customers was able to reduce their IT footprint to 5% of what it previously was, with better results.



Also they just partnered with NVDA

TLDR - put your life savings into $PSTG

Great Opportunity to short $HOOD - Robinhood's Downfall,0,1boseo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1boseo9/great_opportunity_to_short_hood_robinhoods/,53,1711510994.0,"**What we already know about Robinhood's Q4 (**[Link](https://investors.robinhood.com/news/news-details/2024/Robinhood-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results/default.aspx)**)**

* Total net revenues increased by 24% year-over-year to $471 million.
* Net interest revenues surged by 41% year-over-year to $236 million, driven by growth in interest-earning assets and higher short-term interest rates.
* Transaction-based revenues increased by 8% year-over-year to $200 million, with cryptocurrencies revenue up 10%, equities revenue up 19%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in options revenue.
* Position: The current position is almost non-existent with just one contract bought on 3/15/2024, strike at $19 but that will change.  wood Media.
* Net income increased year-over-year to $30 million, or EPS of $0.03, compared to a net loss of $166 million, or EPS of -$0.19, in Q4 2022.
* Total operating expenses decreased by 17% year-over-year to $445 million.
* Adjusted Operating Expenses (non-GAAP) increased by 14% year-over-year to $364 million.
* Share-based compensation (SBC) decreased by 49% year-over-year to $81 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased by 62% year-over-year to $133 million.
* Funded Customers increased by 420 thousand year-over-year to 23.4 million.
* Assets Under Custody (AUC) increased by 65% year-over-year to $102.6 billion.
* Net Deposits were $4.6 billion, with an annualized growth rate of 21% relative to AUC at the end of Q3 2023.
* Gold subscribers increased by 25% year-over-year to 1.42 million.
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased by 23% year-over-year to $81.
* Monthly Active Users (MAU) decreased by 4% year-over-year to 10.9 million.
* Started global expansion in the UK and EU.

**Summary**

Robinhood saw good growth across its revenue streams, with total net revenues increasing by 24% year-over-year but still faces problems with high operating costs, still running at a net loss without being able to get out. In Robinhood's future outlook for the upcoming year(EOY 2024), they have forecasted operational costs of $1.85 - $1.95 billion. However, there has been a 1% year-over-year increase from 2022 to 2023(EOY), with costs rising to $2.40 billion in the past year. Given their current strategies, this decrease seems implausible, making me think that they may be telling investors what they want to hear. Additionally, with users dropping at 4% in just one quarter it sought advancement abroad into the UK/EU (previously attempted/held off) but also noted ""it could be years before the U.K. business becomes profitable, so there‚Äôs no reason to panic."" showing no quick turnaround. Especially with the UK not allowing payment for order flow (the system by which a broker routes customer orders to market-makers in return for a commission) it'll be a long journey to profit, if ever.

**Debit Card - A Safe Bet**

In 2022, Robinhood launched its debit card, marking a strategic move beyond its core trading platform. The aim was to diversify its offerings and become a one-stop spot for all financial needs. This expansion was seen as a measure to mitigate the impact of interest rate hikes and further solidify Robinhood's position in the market.

**March 2024 Robinhood Launches its Credit Card**

To set itself apart from competitors, Robinhood introduced an incentive offering a 3% cashback reward. This surpasses the current leading offer of 2% cash back on cards like Wells Fargo Active Cash. But as shown by history competition will match this as soon as possible.

Although noted as ""No Fees"", a Robinhood Gold Membership is Mandatory & 30 day Trial does not count. $166.67 is needed to spend to offset the Gold Membership(@ 3%). Additionally, No bonus is provided. Considering the common $200 bonus (many $250 as well - March 2024), you'd need to spend  $6666.67 to offset missing the bonus. This is also considering 3% while technically only 1% (need to spend $500 to offset $5 and $20,000 to get the same value as a bonus) should be considered as that's the differentiating factor.

**Summary** - Avoid being tempted by the 3%, it's not good. APR is also high and all other benefits are commonly offered. The card does look good though.

**Credit Company Analysis - Is a Credit Card a good option(puts) for Robinhood right now? The Timing!**

Positives

* More Gold Members
* Transaction Data
* Additional Revenue Stream
* Interest Income (Especially if central banks lower interest rates it will reduce borrowing costs for credit card companies and increase their net interest income which Robinhood will get a portion of from VISA)
* In times of economic uncertainty, consumers rely more heavily on credit cards for everyday purchases.

Negatives (**MAJOR/MAIN FACTORS**)

* Economic downturn results in unemployment, and financial distress which leads to credit card delinquencies and defaults which are detrimental.
* Lower Spending - Cautious about their finances during economic uncertainty
* Goldman Sachs reports that credit card companies are experiencing their highest rate of losses in nearly three decades, excluding the period of the Great Financial Crisis. Currently standing at 3.63%, up from the bottom, they are predicted to increase further to 4.93%. This trend comes amidst record-high credit card debt in the U.S., surpassing $1 trillion.  Analysts anticipate delinquencies to persist beyond typical seasonal patterns, projecting losses to peak in late 2024 or early 2025.

TLDR: After the pump tomorrow from the Gold Credit Card it'll be a great chance to get short positions. The company is not doing good and its credit card move is at a bad time. It's also not going to drop its total operating expenses to $1.95 Billion as it increased 1% year-over-year to $2.40 billion from 2022 to 2023 as reported during the fourth quarter, meaning it will continue in huge loss. The company is also hard to trust due to its prior conduct.

Position: Current position is almost non-existent with just one contract bought on 3/15/2024, strike at $19 June 21, 2024 but that will change.",2024-03-27 03:43:14,2024-03-27 03:43:14+00:00

WRAP Technologies,32,1bp1ovv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bp1ovv/wrap_technologies/,17,1711545578.0,"Good morning regards,

Like all of you others here I am constantly looking for the next play that will allow me to retire, as of now all of my plays have done the opposite and forced me to work for any longer.

BUT this one is different, why you may ask? I will explain.

I am currently a LEO in a large department. As some of you know AXON essentially has a monopoly on the North American law enforcement tech world. I am unsure of the specific numbers, but I‚Äôd wager to say they provide 90% of body cams to agencies across the country. The hardware, however is not where the money is at. AXON also owns TASER and a bunch of other toys the public isn‚Äôt well aware of. What makes AXON so rich, is the way all of their devices integrate. The evidence management software they use is honestly mediocre at best, in terms of user-friendliness. But when that‚Äôs your only option you don‚Äôt really have a choice. AXON makes billions of dollars storing the data. I could go on and on about how each different piece of equipment interacts with each other but that isn‚Äôt too relevant. Long story short is AXON is king, for now.

My agency recently purchased what‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúBOLA Wrap‚Äù. I think they are ridiculous and are no more than a PR stunt to appease people and say ‚Äúlook at this bat tool we have that can safely detain people‚Äù. I digress, but either way these devices at bulk cost are about $1500 per. Not cheap, but won‚Äôt be there long term money maker, but will provide them some short term cash to get to the big bucks.  So I did some digging, and found some interesting other projects WRAP is cooking up. 

They already have a body cam system developed and rolled out as well as an AXON equivalent evidence management/retention system. It also appears they have a RMS system for report writing and management as well. They are also selling a VR training system which can be very valuable to law enforcement/military personnel.

TLDR: WRAP appears to be a legitimate AXON competitor who has already punched its way into the LEO market. IF they can continue to do so, I believe the stock price will fly. Currently trading at 2 dollars a share, it‚Äôs kind of a low risk low cost roll of the dice. 

I am in for 3000 shares.

Tell me why I‚Äôm regarded and will never retire below.

I am long on Tandem

Since 2022 this stock has trended downward, which is great because we can all get it in the 20‚Äôs! I bought on the recent dip, around 23/24$

All analyst ratings are big upside 100%+

Tandem has been putting out a lot of new products in the last year or two, which means heavy research and spending but I believe they are on the brink of a huge move upward

Just to put it out there I have a close relative and a couple of friends who are type 1 diabetics and on insulin pumps so this is also coming directly from the consumers.

Tandem‚Äôs biggest item right now is their insulin pump that works in conjunction with DEXCOM‚Äôs G7 glucose monitoring system!!
    Together these items work as an artificial pancreas, the pump talks to the G7 patch without user input and releases insulin/monitors blood sugars constantly.. no more pricking fingers or counting carbs and fibres.

This pairing is the best on the market and my diabetic friends swear without question this will be the pump they go with when they are up for a new one!
    In Canada, government provides funding for new pumps every X # of years so there is a bit of a delay depending on country and personal financials but without a doubt the way of the future. In their most recent earnings update it listed a healthy rise in warranty users at 8% and have began to stretch globally to Europe as well 

Diabetes isn‚Äôt going anywhere and of course people are going to want what is essentially an artificial pancreas over the counterparts

They just got upgraded to a buy rating which was based solely off doctors and specialist seeing a much larger demand for the continuous glucose monitoring (CCG) than expected, I expected it, been on a 25-30% tear since

My goal is still to see it up to 60 or 80 dollars, IMO it is where comparable companies are trading

I am not saying this so all us regards immediately pump the s**t out of this thing but because I believe there is real potential for a big return here over the next period of time

I bought in the 20‚Äôs and now I‚Äôll buy more in the 30‚Äôs. Options I think May 17 up to 40 strike but I‚Äôm also buying in retirement account

This is my Ted talk and I will be holding TNDM long term, enjoy the tendies ",2024-03-27 13:59:36,2024-03-27 13:59:36+00:00

For the full year 2024, Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL) expects net yields (in constant currency) to increase approximately 9.5% compared to 2023, which is more than a point better than their December guidance, based on continued strength in demand and with occupancy at historical levels. Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel (in constant currency) are anticipated to be $35 million better than December guidance, with adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per available lower berth day (ALBD) (in constant currency) being 0.5 percentage points higher than December guidance due to lower ALBDs from the Red Sea rerouting as certain ships reposition without guests. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $5.63 billion, representing over 30% growth compared to 2023 and better than December guidance despite the impact of the Red Sea rerouting of approximately $130 million or $0.09 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) through November 2024‚Äã‚Äã.

For the second quarter of 2024, CCL anticipates net yields (in constant currency) to be up approximately 10.5% compared to 2023 levels, including the unfavorable impact from the Red Sea rerouting of 0.5 percentage points, with occupancy at historical levels. Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) are expected to increase approximately 3.0% compared to the second quarter of 2023, including the unfavorable impact of 1.3 percentage points as a result of lower ALBDs from the Red Sea rerouting as certain ships reposition without guests. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be approximately $1.05 billion, over 50% growth compared to the second quarter of 2023‚Äã‚Äã.

 

Guidance provided by Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL) indicates expectations of growth through the second quarter of 2024 and beyond. Specifically, the company has raised its full-year 2024 net yield guidance (in constant currency) to approximately 9.5% compared to 2023, signaling anticipated revenue growth. This adjustment is based on continued strength in demand and with occupancy levels at historical highs. Additionally, for the second quarter of 2024, CCL expects net yields (in constant currency) to be up approximately 10.5% compared to 2023 levels, despite the unfavorable impact of certain operational adjustments.

The company's optimism extends into the future as they have begun focusing more on delivering an even stronger 2025, suggesting confidence in sustained growth and operational improvements beyond the current fiscal year. This outlook is underpinned by record booking levels, strong demand across its brands, and strategic operational decisions, including fleet expansion and sustainability initiatives‚Äã‚Äã.",2024-03-27 14:20:38,2024-03-27 14:20:38+00:00

Jokes on him, because I thought I bought mid April expirys for the calls, but then realized a couple of days later that they expired a week from my position open. 

Well I closed that trade out yesterday... I got rather lucky since right after selling my calls, the stock not only lost its gains, but dropped over 7%. 

Anyways, cool. But if I take my Ws and go home, that's boring.

So I bought some more $ARM calls on today's drop.

NVDA Predictions Prior to Earnings,50,1bp3ph3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bp3ph3/nvda_predictions_prior_to_earnings/,40,1711550910.0,"As we can all see, the GTC conference didn‚Äôt act as a major catalyst like many hoped. NVDA managed to breach the ATH for a bit but lost that momentum after Monday (I wish I didn‚Äôt sell my 3/28 $940 put üò©). GTC won‚Äôt have much of an impact on fundamentals until H2 but I think they unveiled a lot of great products, data center initiatives, and partnerships that will be great for value investors in the long run, earning their current market cap. However, this is WSB and we don‚Äôt care about long-run fundamentals so here we go:

My regarded take on NVDA‚Äôs upcoming movements based off religiously watching it every like a mofo.
Based off previous movements, NVDA might bottom out at $875 today or tomorrow and make a slow climb for the next 1-2 weeks towards its ATH and maybe surpass it a bit. However, without any major foreseeable catalysts, I don‚Äôt see NVDA doing much until May. I think NVDA may flirt with $1,000 once or twice, but it won‚Äôt sustainably break it since it‚Äôs a psychological barrier so I‚Äôd recommend call holders to take profits right before that point. 

I have a few June 21 calls with NVDA and I‚Äôve been buying the dips each time (two weeks ago and this week). I‚Äôm wary about earnings now. I think expectations for NVDA are massive and NVDA is already selling at maximum and keeping the margins it‚Äôs already had. Updates from GTC won‚Äôt really factor in for Q1. NVDA would have to blow things out of the water with triple YoY growth again and I don‚Äôt see that happening and so Wall St will be disappointed. I‚Äôll probably sell enough calls to be profitable in April/May and play with house money for post-earnings. We‚Äôll see though and I hope NVDA moons to $1100+. 



TLDR: NVDA will either go up or down. 

(Probably will flirt with $1000 and then go down in April).

Now is the perfect time to buy Luckin Coffee (LKNCY). Why I bought a lot and will hold for years.,0,1bp5z1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bp5z1m/now_is_the_perfect_time_to_buy_luckin_coffee/,43,1711556546.0,"*Disclaimer: I recently purchased \~6,000 shares of Luckin.*

# Let‚Äôs Start With The Macroeconomics

1. **Coffee Growth in China**: The coffee market in China is growing at a CAGR of between 9.8% ([here](https://marketingtochina.com/coffee-franchise-in-china-why-is-it-working/)) and 22% ([here](https://daxueconsulting.com/coffee-in-china/)) with a current PRC TAM of $14.2bn and a projected market size of around $30bn/year by end FY2025 ([here](https://intelligence.coffee/2023/06/pacific-coffee/)). I know the CAGR forecast range is wide, but even the lowest end is double GDP growth rate and in excess of most industries in public markets. The high case is huge. The market is massive and rapidly growing.
2. **Per capita consumption is a rocket ship**: As of 2022, per capita coffee consumption was [***11 cups per year***](https://www.statista.com/topics/7311/coffee-market-in-china/#topicOverview) in Mainland China (up from 9 cups in 2021, up from [3 cups](https://www.alizila.com/china-coffee-consumption-coffee-drinking-nation/) in 2018). As of 2023 and limiting to ‚ÄúTier 1 cities‚Äù, per capita consumption was [326 cups/year](https://ecommercetochina.com/coffee-industry-in-china-2/). This is compared to [***\~600 cups per year***](https://www.statista.com/chart/6088/europes-top-ten-coffee-drinking-nations/) (or more, e.g., US is 1.87 cups/day) in Western markets. Over the next 9 years, China is expected to reach the average worldwide per capita consumption level ([here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/read-chinas-coffee-growth-from-perspective-japan-south-paul-hai-wang/)).
3. **West = Success**: Any long-term watcher of China realizes that a large portion of the Chinese populace is susceptible to wanting to behave like the west because the west = success. Young Chinese have a strong desire to be perceived as globalized and sophisticated, and engaging in Western habits is a proxy for that. Just from my own personal experience as someone who has lived and worked in China recently, this phenomenon does not appear to be going away.
4. **Coffee is Inelastic**: Doesn‚Äôt matter if the market goes to shit, [people still need their fix.](https://www.euromonitor.com/article/demand-protects-coffee-and-tea-industries-from-inflation) Read: if Evergrande tears down the Chinese economy, people still buy coffee.
5. **Revenue in RMB**: Consensus all over the world is that China has undervalued the yuan to increase exports. Substantially all LKNCY revenue is in RMB but the ADR trades in USD. In the event of an appreciation vs the dollar, there will be upward pressure on the price from a fundamental value perspective, and upward pressure on the ADR price because of the FX exposure.

# Let‚Äôs Deal with the ‚ÄúIssue‚Äù

Everyone knows LKNCY defrauded the world to the tune of +$300M back \~2020 by faking revenue. However, a turnaround is a turnaround. The former executives leading the fraud were booted from the company and founded a competitor (Cotti) which is growing fast but bleeding cash. Anyone who has worked in a big enterprise know that ethics in reporting starts with the executive suite an the stockholders -- both have changed.

Moreover, LKNCY was essentially bought out of distress by Centurium Capital. Centurium was founded by David Li. Li was formerly the head of APAC for one of the preeminent PE funds in the world, Warburg Pincus, where he worked for over 14 years.

Warburg Pincus folks are sharp and the firm is the epitome of (somewhat bureaucracy-filled) high-class institutional investing. No one survives 14 years there without rigor around how to bring value to LPs. Centurium was also funded by other heavyweights: Temasek and U.S. pension fund Washington State Investment Board.

The bottom line is that China is risky and it‚Äôs rife with fraud. But this company was shoved into the limelight, bore the consequences and paid the fines, was bought by a fund of repute, and is now more likely than not producing real results. As far as Chinese companies go, this would be one of the least risky small-cap buys in my opinion.

# Let‚Äôs Continue with Fundamentals, Especially When Benchmarked Against Comps

The comps I think referenced for purposes of this analysis are $SBUX, $JDEP.AS, $RBI (for Tim Hortons), $BROS, and to a limited extent Cotti Coffee where limited information is available.

1. **Store Openings + Increasing Same-Store Revenue**: LKNCY doubled its store footprint last year. They‚Äôre looking to add another 25% of new stores this year. The new-store growth rate obliterates the comps. In addition, the new store openings, combined with the trend in increasing per capita coffee consumption (LKNCY said same-store revenue growth was \~20% in their recent annual filings), means +++ revenue opportunities. 
2. **Revenue & Gross Profit**: LKNCY revenue has grown at a 71.28% CAGR over the last 4 years following ‚ÄúThe Issue‚Äù. This obliterates every comp, which range between 10-25%/year. Comps are largely competing in saturated markets where TAM is capped out. They are limited to growing revenue based on the GDP growth rate and stealing customers from each other. They aren‚Äôt competing for ‚Äúnet new‚Äù consumers. Those that are operating in China are doing it in a different market segment (SBUX is simply too expensive for daily consumption given average salaries). Luckin, on the other hand, is competing for ‚Äúnet new‚Äù consumers in a rising tide industry. There is a ton of room for growth in China. Luckin‚Äôs gross margin between 56-60% also obliterates the comps. Finally, Luckin is likely to put further downward pressure on its COGS with the opening of new ‚Äúgreen bean‚Äù plants (other chains like SBUX has demonstrated success with this strategy). I do think that protecting profit margin will be an issue with the entrance of newer low-cost high-growth competitors like Cotti. There was a recent ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù in China where the two companies went head to head in ridiculous promotions. But I think Cotti will run out of cash before they win this war. Also, there‚Äôs a ton of news about how shitty and inconsistent service at Cotti is. On balance LKNCY is the only reputable and well capitalized fast-growing player in this space.
3. **No Material Debt & The Company Throws Off Free Cash**: Following the resolution of their convertible note issues, they have no material debt dragging on the business. They also make free cash flow rain. Go ahead and project the financials at a conservative but reasonable rate and do a DCF yourself (I did, more on that below). 
4. **Ridiculous P/E**: LKNCY‚Äôs ***trailing*** P/E multiple is about 19. Comps are up in the high 20s or 30s, and these companies are GDP-tracking from a growth perspective. A profitable 70% revenue CAGR business at 19x trailing P/E? Give me a break, it‚Äôs basically free.

# Let‚Äôs Talk Momentum and Technical Catalysts

I‚Äôm not a big technical guy. One thing I do know, however, is that many large funds can‚Äôt buy OTC stocks. Luckin currently trades OTC. If Luckin were to list again on an exchange, it would open up the cap table to U.S.-based institutional investors. I can‚Äôt imagine a price pop not occurring from this eventuality, whether from increased demand or expansion in the P/E multiple.

# Things to Watch

Of course, China is one of the most competitive consumer markets in the world, and Luckin isn‚Äôt a company like NVDA innovating in a space to create a market. As a result, a lot of future developments could adversely affect company performance or stock price, and any investment in LKNCY merits at least quarterly monitoring from a fundamental and competitive perspective.

# The Only Conclusion

I built out a model forecasting the financial statements through FY2027 and did a DCF, all against the contextual backdrop (partially) summarized above, and I see present intrinsic value of \~$60 per share. I even put a sensitivity table in to toggle WACC vs perpetuity growth rate or EBITDA exit multiple, and the shittiest combination from both of the sensitivity analyses gives me $43.71/share for today‚Äôs intrinsic value.

The base case represents a +100% upside on a hypergrowth business. The discounted cash flow analysis, together with the rosy outlook for coffee in China, makes LKNCY a value investment and a growth investment at the same time, which is why I backed up the truck to load up.",2024-03-27 16:22:26,2024-03-27 16:22:26+00:00

$RDDT will be the next generational short squeeze,0,1bp74ik,https://i.redd.it/yo39o5mmswqc1.jpeg,40,1711559328.0,"Twitter was acquired for $44B back in 2022 and the bottom of the bear market. Reddit‚Äôs current market cap is $9B with the same business model and much stronger user engagement and loyalty. Market cap should be at least $20B based on current market and metrics.

The regards at Hedgeye also just made a grave mistake in trying to short Reddit at the beginning of this new ‚Äúeverything only goes up market‚Äù. Idk who let one of their junior analysts spearhead this short, but Reddit is brewing up to be a perfect storm. Shorts are getting desperate because they‚Äôre used to easy plays from the bear market and will overestimate the downside to hot stocks in this market so they will overallocate their shorts outside of their traditional risk profiles. Reddit was responsible for creating the game stop short squeeze (an unprofitable business flat out); but once the the WSB regards and normal retail jump in we may even see one of the craziest jumps of this new cycle and an outsized valuation for the stock. 

For complete transparency I‚Äôm in for $15k but will add at least another to $85k to my position by June and will buy all the way down to $25 if needed (I believe $50 will be support here if shorts can break daily lows).

Stay Away from BA - BUY ERJ!! Embraer is the Boeing of 40 years ago,8,1bp8wh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bp8wh2/stay_away_from_ba_buy_erj_embraer_is_the_boeing/,18,1711563634.0,"Boeing fucking sucks, but shorting their stock or buying puts its not smart. They just fired their shitty CEO and the stock shot up 2%. I'm sure BA will keep shooting themselves in the foot, but in the meantime they are being rewarded for very basic improvements. Stay away.

**Instead buy ERJ**. Embraer is the the third largest plane maker in the world and we really need more planes right now.

**Bullish:**

* They have a young portfolio of really well engineered aircraft: their executive jets have been the best selling for the last ~10 years and continue to see increased demand, their commercial narrow body planes, the E2 series, are the quietest, cleanest, and cheapest to fly regionally, even besting Airbus in most situations. Passengers rate them highly for comfort and they are very reliable.
* Their new C-390 Millennium military transport plane looks like it is taking off, with huge new orders from top tier militaries like South Korea and Saudi Arabia. The C-390 is superior in almost every way to the ancient Lockheed Martin C-130. If the C-390 replaces the C-130, that will means massive orders down the line and huge long term maintenance contracts. South Korea is known as a particularly efficient military, and will prove to be an excellent showcase.
* Airbus and Boeing are booked SOLID for 8-12 years, whereas Embraer has only ~3 years of backlog for their commercial planes. Embraer is much more likely to benefit from the manufacturing and brand struggles of Boeing than airbus.
* Profit from the maintenance unit has been bullish, this is a lagging indicator of fundamental business strength.
* Their aircraft have some of the lowest life cycle costs and highest uptime, the main reason they are not a 50-100B company is because of the Boeing / Airbus duopoly (as well as the SCOPE clause, see bearish below), which is starting to look like less of an obstacle.
* Many US carriers are rightfully pissed at Boeing and want more options. Some have openly questioned their commitments to orders currently on the books. Who else can they buy from? Not Airbus unless they want to wait forever. That leave only ERJ.
* They recently received ETOPS 120-minute approval from Brazil's ANAC, the FAA, and the EU's EASA for the E190-E2 and E195-E2 - more opportunity for sales in more markets.
* Their CEO, Francisco Gomes Neto is a badass. He was meant to lead the company sale to Boeing, but that fell through due to COVID and Boeing backing out. The reason Boeing wanted to purchase Embraer? For their well respected engineering talent. In other words, they are the Boeing of 40 years ago. Of course pulling out of the deal majorly fucked Embraer, which was about to release a major competitor to Boeing (E175-E2) in the US market (still on ice to this day). For the last ~3 years, Neto has been rebuilding Embraer into a fundamentally strong company with a great culture. He seems honest and upfront, in total contrast to Boeing's constant PR bullshit. Also worth noting - since Boeing pulled out they have been trying to poach Embraer engineer. Embraer has only lost around 100 engineers (according to last earnings call) and are suing Boeing. Embraer is like the young scrappy upstart with all the potential, and are just now hitting their growth spurt. Boeing has been keeping them down but are now weakened.
* Morgan Stanley recently upgraded their price target from $19 to $40, Goldman Sachs increased theirs from $21 to $35. 
* They just inked a huge deal with American Airlines for $7B - 90 aircraft. This could be the start of much wider industry adoption. Once the dominoes start to fall and their order book grows, ERJ will explode in value.

**Bearish:**

* They have been limited in selling their popular narrow body jets in the US market due to protectionist SCOPE clauses which limit the specific type of aircraft allowed at regional airports. There is no plan to have this scrapped in the next ~3 years. HOWEVER, if and when SCOPE is scrapped, expect a huge boost for ERJ.

* ERJ faces the long term ""pilot problem"" of not having enough pilots trained with their craft, combined with an overall pilot shortage means its difficult for some airlines to adopt them.

Guys today is a great day. These days are clear indications of how the markets are regulating themselves and the irregularities caused by the inflated market caps of some companies wont affect small and mid caps over the long run.

Today NVDA-GOOG-MSFT are down slightly and the rest of the markets is up, and just because these three companies are down, the index is down. 

This indicates that some etfs and index funds are just over concentrated.

The real damage came from me increasing the number of calls in my Roth IRA yesterday to about $8,000 total. If it wasn‚Äôt for that gamble, I would be about even today. Some people were talking smack because I bought mostly shares and not calls. But this decision saved my account.

JPMorgan says stocks are so crowded they may crack at anytime.,23,1bpd440,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-27/jpmorgan-says-crowded-stocks-sow-risk-of-out-of-the-blue-shock,30,1711573775.0," ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the talk of the stock market: What will be the sign that the five-month rally in US equities is coming to an end. But if you ask JPMorgan Chase Co.‚Äôs Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, investors may not see it coming when it hits.

The Wall Street giant‚Äôs chief global equity strategist warned clients on Wednesday that they could be ‚Äústuck on the wrong side‚Äù of the momentum trade when it eventually falters, and he encouraged them to consider diversifying their holdings and thinking about risk management in their portfolios. He also reiterated his warning that excessive crowding in the market‚Äôs best-performing stocks raises the risk of an imminent correction.

‚ÄúIt just might come one day out of the blue. This has happened in the past, we‚Äôve had flash crashes,‚Äù Lakos-Bujos said in a webinar. ‚ÄúOne big fund starts de-levering some positions, a second fund hears that and tries to re-position, the third fund basically gets caught off guard, and the next thing you know, we start having a bigger and bigger momentum unwind.‚Äù

His remarks come in the final trading days of a strong first quarter for stocks, with the S&P 500 Index on track for a roughly 10% return. The broad US equities benchmark will post its fifth consecutive month of gains as corporate earnings remain strong, enthusiasm around artificial intelligence keeps building, the US economy continues to be healthy and the Federal Reserve signals its willingness to cut interest rates this year¬†

But to Lakos-Bujas, that list actually is a reason for concern.¬†

‚ÄúA lot of goodies have gotten priced in,‚Äù he said, from earnings and Fed expectations, to even a potential election victory for former president Donald Trump, which he said would be viewed as helpful for the market. Moreover, he sees few sources of upside surprise beyond Nvidia Corp. and the prospects for AI innovation. ‚ÄúThat source of upside surprise is becoming more and more limited, and on the flipside, you do have more risks that are hovering in the background,‚Äù he said.

Moreover, looking at recent history, the rush into popular momentum stocks like the Magnificent Seven typically is followed by a correction. It‚Äôs happened three times since the Global Financial Crisis.

‚ÄúHistorically, whenever you had such a high degree of crowding it was a question of weeks before the momentum factor faced a big fat left tail unwind,‚Äù Lakos-Bujas said, pointing to Tesla Inc.‚Äôs 27% plunge and Apple Inc.‚Äôs 10% drop this year after strong 2023s as examples of what‚Äôs to come.

‚ÄúWho is going to be the next one ‚Äî and when?‚Äù he said.

Lakos-Bujas and other strategists at JPMorgan, including Marko Kolanovic, have been among few bearish contrarians on Wall Street this year. As most of their peers raise their US equity outlooks, with the stock market continually setting new highs, they have remained pessimistic that the gains would stick. Among the big Wall Street banks, the firm holds the lowest year-end target on the S&P 500 of 4,200, implying a drop of nearly 20% from Wednesday‚Äôs level.

The bank‚Äôs house view on US equities has failed to materialize for two consecutive years as Lakos-Bujas and Kolanovic remained bullish throughout most of 2022‚Äôs rout and then held a bearish stance during last year‚Äôs 24% rally in the S&P 500.‚Äù",2024-03-27 21:09:35,2024-03-27 21:09:35+00:00

ASML: the Next stock in the AI market move,6,1bpe7px,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bpe7px/asml_the_next_stock_in_the_ai_market_move/,17,1711576439.0,"Who is asml? I‚Äôll keep this simple. They are a leader in the manufacturing of chip making equipment.  Companies like Intel and TSMC buy their equipment to make chip plants

Why is ASML so interesting? Cause they are making the world‚Äôs first 2 nano meter lithography machines (that‚Äôs really fucking small and enables next level AI chips and memory). Per the article below they are already sold out to Intel and others and are expanding their capacity

I‚Äôll keep this straightforward: Nvidia and Micron, Intel , etc all need this tech to make more and more powerful AI chips.  

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asml-launch-high-na-lithography-machine-2nm-chip-manufacturing-i9dac?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&utm_campaign=share_via

Risks: this 2 na tech is brand new and very cutting edge.  There maybe delays as it gets production ramped up as TSM and others evaluate and work through kinks

Now let‚Äôs look at the stock:

It‚Äôs at all time highs and isn‚Äôt cheap with a PE of 44 (vs 75 for NVDIA).  Note it actually have a dividend yield at .68%. So the metrics are a little expensive but not really stretched.  I expect their next earnings call (April 17) to be a huge catalyst as  2na adoption is discussed

TLDR:
These guys have the shit every chip mfg is going to have to have to compete for the most advanced AI processors and memory.   This is a ‚Äúshovels and mortar‚Äù play for AI and will be a slower stock rise than others but should see another 50% in the next year as people see 2na chip machines get bought.  Near term catalyst is April 17 earnings call. 

Note: there are real risks with chip tech this advanced. I wouldn‚Äôt YOLO it but if you want to be more risky i would do some slightly out of the money option plays if your due diligence agrees with mine around April 17. Personally i am doing stock for now.

""In 2023, we made progress on reducing inflation and improving the job market, but recent data has made me unsure about the pace of this progress. February's job gains and inflation measures have been stronger than expected, indicating that we need more time to assess the situation. So, I don't see a need to rush into cutting interest rates just yet.""

""Looking at the economic performance, GDP growth is expected to slow this quarter, but it's still solid. Consumer spending is moderating, especially on goods, while services spending is growing moderately. Business surveys show mixed results, with manufacturing activity contracting slightly while nonmanufacturing businesses continue to expand.""

""As for the job market, recent data suggests strong job gains, but the unemployment rate rose slightly, mainly due to more young people being counted as unemployed. The number of people quitting their jobs has decreased, indicating less turnover, which means firms aren't competing as much for workers.""

""Regarding productivity, recent growth has been fast, but it's uncertain whether it will continue. Factors like large investment projects and resolving supply chain issues may have boosted productivity in the short term, but it's unclear if this will be sustained.""

""On inflation, recent data has been disappointing, with both total and core inflation increasing. While there are reasons to believe progress will continue, we need to monitor the situation closely.""

""Overall, I believe there's no rush to cut interest rates. The economy is strong, and waiting a little longer to assess the trajectory of inflation is the prudent approach.""

Drill baby drill! Possible 25-bagger calls.,10,1bpf4fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bpf4fv/drill_baby_drill_possible_25bagger_calls/,6,1711578628.0,"**Disclamer: this DD includes leaps.**

**The US oil industry is booming.** Since 2022 the international energy markets have been going crazy. Firstly because of the sanctions on Russian oil, and secondly because of the supply cuts done by Saudis and Russians. To combat the problem of rising oil and gas prices the US has increased its oil production to a record high making it the largest oil producer in the world. This is quite funny considering that the Biden administration has also done more work towards cutting the emissions than anyone before. There is no going back to Russian oil for Europe and the tensions in the Middle East makes US the most important and reliable supplier. Even if Biden gets re-elected, the oil boom will likely continue for the upcoming years because of the geopolitical factors ‚Äì US is the safest supplier and everyone still needs oil. Now the wild card is if Trump gets re-elected. The political climate will go from saving the planet to a complete climate change denialism and the consequences will lead to a rally like never before. Trumps re-election cannot be priced in until it is certain but the expectations will be very high and thus the premiums will be through the roof. Now my strategy is to buy leaps right now so I will be positioned beforehand. This cannot go south because we are booming already and the pressure of inflation will force Biden to keep it drillin‚Äô in any case. If Trump wins it's only extra.

And I know what you are thinking. What‚Äôs the point of buying leaps? they are too expensive and I can‚Äôt lose my account in a week with them‚Ä¶ but they are not. At least this one isn‚Äôt. Plains All American, Ticker: PAA, PAGP(holding company).

The industry is divided into three segments: upstream, midstream and downstream. I know you don‚Äôt care about this but the point is that midstream companies are more stable against commodity price fluctuations and they benefit from increased demand. The politics almost guarantee the high demand. Here is the list of the biggest midstream companies:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/r1r1xrkbayqc1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe0fe9e0679dbefcf47b173c0a109a0b27031443)

PAA is the 11. largest on the list. I looked through the options on all of these and PAA has dirt cheap premiums. EPD, ET, KMI had also low premiums so I suggest you look through the others too. The PAA stock is doing good, 9/10 positive earnings streak, doing good financially, couple of oil spills to make a reputation, no former employees assassinated etc. The stock has already gone up by about 50% in the past year and is at 17$. I bought jan/25 20$ calls for 20c and jan/26 22$ calls for 25c a piece. The stock has ATH at 61$ and if it goes to 25$ for example that‚Äôs already a 25-bagger. Now I know that's a big increase, about 50% in 10 months, but think about pricing in 4 years worth of oil drilling heaven. And If Trump doesn't win, OK, we are still going to go up since the demand just keeps growing. The premiums should really be 10x higher this far out. The upside leverage is just insane.

**My positions:**
