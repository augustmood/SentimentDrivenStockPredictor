Oil crashed multiple times in the last 18 years: 60+% during the great recession ($120 -> $40), and then another 60+% drop again after the supply shock of 2014-2015, and then another 60+% drop again during COVID. Each time, oil stocks, including PAA, suffered. PAA fell 50% during the great recession, 60%ish during the supply shock, and then close to 70% during COVID. Oil prices fall during a recession because demand declines (whether it actually declines doesn't matter, it is just the speculation that it will decline).\n",
