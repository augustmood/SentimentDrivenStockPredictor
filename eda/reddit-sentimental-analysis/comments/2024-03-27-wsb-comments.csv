To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. 

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",1,

Ignoring of course, that this doesn't always work out and carries substantial risk that they stall out or worse, once again fall back into burning a ton of cash where there isn't going to be a second chance. And the gaming industry is nothing if not insanely competive and in many places largely calcified.

Plus, if you buy in at $22/share and it actually did start to grow again, it could take most of or even more than a decade for Gamestop worth to ever actually fundamentally be worth that much. That is well above Gamestop's historic highs when it was in its golden years and when it was far, far healthier and trying to diversify(and later fail at)",1,

Not only that MJ has a Defensive Player of the year award, with another he deserved that was robbed from him, because the Bulls were abysmal that season. 

MJ also has 2.3 avg steal per game in his career, which would actually be closer to 3 if not for that needless stint with the Wizards. 

People talk like Lebron is something, but stat wise, Lebron comes nowhere near MJ level. Lebron is also half the man MJ is in defense. For a big dude who's supposedly so great in defense, the only thing he can do is pass and rebound, but can't defend for shit and has has the most turnovers all-time.",1,

2024-03-27 06:06:05+00:00,"There are a half dozen of these things in the pipeline using different approaches to the issue.

So the first round were single GLP-1 agonists.  Semaglutide was the biggest one (a bunch came before it but they all sucked).  There was a daily oral and a weekly injection and they achieved something like 5-10% total weight loss on average.

Next up was Tirzepatide (Zepbound) which is a once weekly injection that includes a GLP-1 agonist and a GIP agonist (dual agonist).  So it hits two different receptors.   Significantly more weight loss, 15% in the highest doses in some people due to the combination of compounds.

Currently in Phase 2 trials is Retatrutide which is a triple agonist with GLP-1/GIP/glucagon and which has achieved 25% weight loss in some subjects.    That's Eli Lilly.

Viking's drug is a dual agonist like tirzepatide which should make it better than semaglutide on fundamental principles.  Digging around it looks like Viking's new drug may generate FASTER weight loss than the Tirzepatide.  So Viking's drug got 13% weight loss by week 13 (when the study stopped so they might have kept losing) vs 20 weeks for tirzepatide (with weight loss continuing for 72 weeks).

Viking is also working on an oral which would make it the first oral dual agonist.  I don't have the energy to see if there are other differences in stuff like side effects or whatever.

Honestly I think the one to watch is Amgen's Maritide.  It uses monoclonal antibodies to increase GLP-1 receptor sensitivity (rather than just activating the receptor) which is novel.  It also does something unique at the GIP receptor but I haven't delved into the details yet.   

It's also once/monthly which is a lot more convenient for people.  Finally, over at least 150 days after stopping, weight is not regained and this is in contrast to the others.  If it is causing some permanent or even long term change that allows people to go off of it for extended periods, that'd be huge.",3,

I already have a Canada Goose Expedition from 2020, and it seems to be a BIFL thing (atleast 10+ years?). Spent $1500 for that but it was worth it. 

Paid $700 for an Arcteryx down jacket, and the thing gets soaking damp and wet in mild rain. Like what? How do you have a $700 rain puffer that gets soaking wet? Aso paid $400 for their hiking shoes, which they provided a 2 time repair coupon for. Shoes broke after literally 2 months. Like broke. WTF. Went in to the store to repair and they wanted to charge $200 to repair the shoes. NEVER buying from Arc'teryx ever again",1,
