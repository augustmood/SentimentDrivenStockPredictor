I've tried posting this DD last night due to the upcoming earnings for the following day, however I had failed to meet the karma requirement. Now I am back with a proper analysis after we've learnt about the earnings report that came out AH today.\\n\\nSo let's go over a short summary of the numbers\\n\\nRumble has a short interest of 4.96% as of February 29, 2024.\\n\\nRumble has been up nearly 60% since january 18th's pump and has been lying in a rising wedge for countless weeks in the anticipation for $DWAC and the truth social merger. There's also the case for Rumble cloud, but that is a nonexistent market right now and will likely be for the rest of 2025 to 2027.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yh988wayyqc1.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=29cea98436585d15c8fbe6335a17fc3ad9a4b990\\n\\nNow, here's where it gets fun :)\\n\\nSo Rumble reported their latest quarterly earnings for fiscal Q4 2023 and there's a eps of -0.14 vs -0.22, however the revenue generated was much less than anticipated. Although the reported revenue was YOY 106% from 2022 to 2023, the company had undertook a massive hit in terms of revenue costs for 20mill vs the expected result of 28mill. Their expenses rose by nearly 40%, their net loss from operating activities rose by over 100x and current assets dropping by 35% through YoY from the prior year.\\n\\nNow, although this company may try to stay afloat, their main source of income relies on analytics, this play however will act as a short term correction to earlier supports to retest resistence. There are 15.260k calls and 5.240k puts open from closing that will expire tomorrow. This also carries an IV% of 360.99%, however if you look at the rest of the options chain you'll see something different compared to $DJT...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jq15qj2a1zqc1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a30d5bb083a100e530669140852ee5b73100b4\\n\\nUnlike $DJT, the IV seems to go down as more time progresses, meaning the puts and calls are cheaper with very low open interest.\\n\\nFor the near term, I expect these calls to backfire and draw puts options in the short term window here to go higher due to an expected correction. Now, it is probably going to start tomorrow as the wick forms on the daily close. However, it may expand into next week where we start expecting the targets.\\n\\nThe probably targets for tomorrow morning are either 8.8$, or more likely 7.8$. We know that in AH, trading already fell through the 200day moving average twice. This can in turn lead to a bigger downside that will open to the 14 day RSI at 7.41. As for how low we'll go in this cycle, I would say as low as 5.5$.\\n\\nWe're also close toa  death cross in the 50day ma vs the 200day ma on the 1day chart, which is expected to occur tomorrow if we continue to decline (purple lines). Although in general 9day, 18day, 20day and 150day ma are already crossed so we are at the debut of a bearish reversal.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e99j9ksm3zqc1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7c7e0f6ad7627e50e314295567a50b3e92765a2\\n\\nI think we will trigger this cycle tomorrow and you may disregard my regarded stance, however there's  likely minimal risks for this trade and it is relatively small at a short gain of \\\\~35%, with a lower possibility of going much lower, however it is possible as well.\\n\\nNow, there's also very little short interest. If other investors flock to open shorts before the rest of the market, you may be locked out before the dump and rely on forward contracts for puts.\\n\\nSee you regards tomorrow and if I am wrong, then I'll see you at Wendy's.\\n\\n&#x200B;\", 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'wallstreetbets', 'title': '$RUM puts for tomorrow, target of 5.5$', 'upvote_ratio': 0.92, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bpikuj/rum_puts_for_tomorrow_target_of_55/'}\n"

       " 'selftext': \"Hello fellow well regarded individuals,\\n\\nI present my DD analysis on the ticker $RUM. I've tried posting this DD last night due to the upcoming earnings for the following day, however I had failed to meet the karma requirement. Now I am back with a proper analysis after we've learnt about the earnings report that came out AH today.\\n\\nSo let's go over a short summary of the numbers\\n\\nRumble has a short interest of 4.96% as of February 29, 2024.\\n\\nRumble has been up nearly 60% since january 18th's pump and has been lying in a rising wedge for countless weeks in the anticipation for $DWAC and the truth social merger. There's also the case for Rumble cloud, but that is a nonexistent market right now and will likely be for the rest of 2025 to 2027.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yh988wayyqc1.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=29cea98436585d15c8fbe6335a17fc3ad9a4b990\\n\\nNow, here's where it gets fun :)\\n\\nSo Rumble reported their latest quarterly earnings for fiscal Q4 2023 and there's a eps of -0.14 vs -0.22, however the revenue generated was much less than anticipated. Although the reported revenue was YOY 106% from 2022 to 2023, the company had undertook a massive hit in terms of revenue costs for 20mill vs the expected result of 28mill. Their expenses rose by nearly 40%, their net loss from operating activities rose by over 100x and current assets dropping by 35% through YoY from the prior year.\\n\\nNow, although this company may try to stay afloat, their main source of income relies on analytics, this play however will act as a short term correction to earlier supports to retest resistence. There are 15.260k calls and 5.240k puts open from closing that will expire tomorrow. This also carries an IV% of 360.99%, however if you look at the rest of the options chain you'll see something different compared to $DJT...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jq15qj2a1zqc1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a30d5bb083a100e530669140852ee5b73100b4\\n\\nUnlike $DJT, the IV seems to go down as more time progresses, meaning the puts and calls are cheaper with very low open interest.\\n\\nFor the near term, I expect these calls to backfire and draw puts options in the short term window here to go higher due to an expected correction. Now, it is probably going to start tomorrow as the wick forms on the daily close. However, it may expand into next week where we start expecting the targets.\\n\\nThe probably targets for tomorrow morning are either 8.8$, or more likely 7.8$. We know that in AH, trading already fell through the 200day moving average twice. This can in turn lead to a bigger downside that will open to the 14 day RSI at 7.41. As for how low we'll go in this cycle, I would say as low as 5.5$.\\n\\nWe're also close toa  death cross in the 50day ma vs the 200day ma on the 1day chart, which is expected to occur tomorrow if we continue to decline (purple lines). Although in general 9day, 18day, 20day and 150day ma are already crossed so we are at the debut of a bearish reversal.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e99j9ksm3zqc1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7c7e0f6ad7627e50e314295567a50b3e92765a2\\n\\nI think we will trigger this cycle tomorrow and you may disregard my regarded stance, however there's  likely minimal risks for this trade and it is relatively small at a short gain of \\\\~35%, with a lower possibility of going much lower, however it is possible as well.\\n\\nNow, there's also very little short interest. If other investors flock to open shorts before the rest of the market, you may be locked out before the dump and rely on forward contracts for puts.\\n\\nSee you regards tomorrow and if I am wrong, then I'll see you at Wendy's.\\n\\n&#x200B;\",\n",
