I can't miss out on this one, probably the biggest play of the season.  I'll be posting my choice later this afternoon but I'm curious as to what your opinions are.\\n\\nAny takers?\\n\\n**UPDATE:** I can't make up my mind and I haven't taken lunch, so I'll literally leave it up to you. It's a coin flip either way.  I'm going to post 2 comments below.  Vote up what you think I should do.  I'll buy a single OTM May option with the winning sentiment when I get back.  \\n\\n**UPDATE 2:** Not looking good, boys.... looks like volatility sellers will be the only winners.  But this can also change after the conference call.  Maybe David Einhorn can hop on the call and ask about their accounting, then the shorts will take it. |->| PCLN - Who's here crazy enough to play this?

Helps keep morale up and emotion in check. |->| Care to teach me your secrets as well? |->| After a two month break, I've come back having one of the best trading months ever: portfolio up 65% for the month so far.

I honestly wasn't worried about the options last night, though I was fretting over *my* plays for the pennies.  I'm sure the reverse is true of jartek.

No worries until after 3 pm.  Got it\\n\\n*a few hours later* this is what we were facing.  By now, AP's (and my) puts are worth $0.30.  That's an additional $252 loss to his account, leaving him with only $120 in cash if we were to liquidate at this point.\\n\\n    [15:13] &lt;jartek_&gt; alright man, i'm going to have to make a tough call\\n    [15:14] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Alright, I'm here, what's up.\\n\\nThe trooper and I had an active deliberation session about possible outcomes and the gravity of the implications I was facing.  After all, worst case scenario this is costing him 76% of his initial investment -- well past the $250 optional eject seat option built into the contest.  This is now serious.  \\n\\nShortly after, connection problems and desperation with trying to communicate with eachother even led to other WSBers trying to help out with the situation:\\n\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; Umm hello\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; Ok, i got disconnected for a minute there.\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; jartek, pm me.\\n    [15:47] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; jartek, I need some direction here; the markets close in 10 minutes!\\n    [15:47] * americanpegasus Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)\\n    [15:47] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; We holding?\\n    [15:47] * americanpegasus_ Quit (Client Quit)\\n    [15:47] &lt;jartek_&gt; did you get my pm?\\n    [15:48] &lt;jartek_&gt; here i'll try again\\n    [15:48] * americanpegasus has joined #wallstreetbets\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; I keep getting disconnected, wtf.\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; jartek, text me or pm me.\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Market closes soon, need some instructions.\\n    [15:48] &lt;jartek_&gt; i'm sending you messages\\n    [15:50] &lt;Rex&gt; jartek_ you going to dump those puts before close?\\n\\nIntensity was at its peak.  At this point, [this is what the market was looking like](http://i.imgur.com/32Cc7.png).  After some intense back-and-fourth I made the executive decision to hold it overnight, much against my original intentions.  Decisions which I will share for those of you who are curious, but for the reasons of finishing this post I'll omit them.  AP bravely accepted his fate.\\n\\nAs you know, the markets dropped only minutes before that, raising the contract price back up to $0.66 before the market closed.  After that, after hours for SPY dropped the price an additional $0.22.  After factoring in time decay, the fact that tomorrow is the expiration date for this option, and its current projected price means that absolutely anything could happen.  By my calculations, AP is currently sitting on a loss around $30 from today's trade.  But this means nothing, as tomorrow there will surely be a change.  If SPY goes up, he'll make money on this epic bet otherwise it could prove disasterous.\\n\\nWelcome to /r/wallstreetbets\\n\\n*(to be continued...)*\\n\\n    \\n |->| Options v.

Shortly after, [while SPY was rising](http://i.imgur.com/MTeE8.png) and making him feel better but I made him feel better.\\n\\n    [12:11] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; But it's down!\\n    [12:11] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; NOooooooooooooooo\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; no, don't worry\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; no, don't worry\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; it may have to wait until 3pm too\\n    [12:12] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; What happens if it never triggers?\\n    [12:12] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; What kind of loss are we looking at?\\n    [12:12] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; If we exercise.\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; well, we're not exercising\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; we're selling them back to the market\\n    [12:22] &lt;jartek_&gt; no worries until after 3pm\\n    [12:22] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Ok.  No worries until after 3 pm.  Got it\\n\\n*a few hours later* this is what we were facing.  By now, AP's (and my) puts are worth $0.30.  That's an additional $252 loss to his account, leaving him with only $120 in cash if we were to liquidate at this point.\\n\\n    [15:13] &lt;jartek_&gt; alright man, i'm going to have to make a tough call\\n    [15:14] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Alright, I'm here, what's up.\\n\\nThe trooper and I had an active deliberation session about possible outcomes and the gravity of the implications I was facing.  After all, worst case scenario this is costing him 76% of his initial investment -- well past the $250 optional eject seat option built into the contest.  This is now serious.  \\n\\nShortly after, connection problems and desperation with trying to communicate with eachother even led to other WSBers trying to help out with the situation:\\n\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; Umm hello\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; Ok, i got disconnected for a minute there.\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; jartek, pm me.\\n    [15:47] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; jartek, I need some direction here; the markets close in 10 minutes!\\n    [15:47] * americanpegasus Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)\\n    [15:47] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; We holding?\\n    [15:47] * americanpegasus_ Quit (Client Quit)\\n    [15:47] &lt;jartek_&gt; did you get my pm?\\n    [15:48] &lt;jartek_&gt; here i'll try again\\n    [15:48] * americanpegasus has joined #wallstreetbets\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; I keep getting disconnected, wtf.\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; jartek, text me or pm me.\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Market closes soon, need some instructions.\\n    [15:48] &lt;jartek_&gt; i'm sending you messages\\n    [15:50] &lt;Rex&gt; jartek_ you going to dump those puts before close?\\n\\nIntensity was at its peak.  At this point, [this is what the market was looking like](http://i.imgur.com/32Cc7.png).  After some intense back-and-fourth I made the executive decision to hold it overnight, much against my original intentions.  Decisions which I will share for those of you who are curious, but for the reasons of finishing this post I'll omit them.  AP bravely accepted his fate.\\n\\nAs you know, the markets dropped only minutes before that, raising the contract price back up to $0.66 before the market closed.  After that, after hours for SPY dropped the price an additional $0.22.  After factoring in time decay, the fact that tomorrow is the expiration date for this option, and its current projected price means that absolutely anything could happen.  By my calculations, AP is currently sitting on a loss around $30 from today's trade.  But this means nothing, as tomorrow there will surely be a change.  If SPY goes up, he'll make money on this epic bet otherwise it could prove disasterous.\\n\\nWelcome to /r/wallstreetbets\\n\\n*(to be continued...)*\\n\\n    \\n|true       |\n",

If you are a penny stock trader, then you know AwesomePennyStocks (APS) is hands down the best promoter out there. Since they are releasing sometime in the next week or two, I thought I'd see if I can nail down which worthless company they decide to promote.

If you see any tickers which you think don't belong on this list, leave a comment. Also, keep your eyes peeled for new tickers with heavy volume on the OTCBB exchange, as that's a pretty good predictor as well.\\n |->| To AmericanPegasus and my other fellow penny stock traders, I present my AwesomePennyStocks watchlist.
