Last pump  in mid 2023, both CGC & ACB were double where they are now. CGC leading with gains and will probably go higher.  ACB flagging on daily chart with short interest over 20% with lower float (15M). Shorts keeping this one down. Has better reward to risk since it did pop to 11s in a single day. Has options but OI low, which means premiums low (although IV 150%+) seems to follow CGC‚Äôs lead.

Tesla Comeback ,1,1bqe0hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqe0hs/tesla_comeback/,13,1711679151.0,"Hello regards! Another regard doing yet another DD on Tesla. 

First off obviously Tesla has seen quite a fall from grace once touted as one of the magnificent seven it is one of the worst performing S&P stocks this year with losses of 30%. Despite this I believe Tesla is positioned to make a very strong come back and become a multi trillion dollar company in the near future. 

First of all, despite what other regards say, Tesla makes a majority of its revenue on car sales. With that in mind EV sales still only account for about 9% of new car sales in the US. Meaning the market for EV sales is still relatively nascent and I believe that 2024 will be a watershed year for EVs. Part of the reason why Tesla's share price has shut the bed is because their margins have continued to decline. This is in part due to inflation and also a price war with primarily BYD in China. However, recently the price of lithium has plummeted and we are now seeing this price swing begin to make it's way into the margins of battery prices. Recently BYD and CATL [announced](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/26/catl-byd-to-slash-battery-prices-by-50-in-2024-boom-evs-win/) that they will be cutting the costs of their Iron Phosphate battiers by 50% making them around 56 $/kWh well below the DOE's threshold to make EVs cost competitive with ICE cars before incentives. Although we can't say Tesla will be able to do the same I imagine this price decrease is in part due to the rapid decline in lithium prices. In the near term we can expect Tesla to increase its margins and in the mid term we can expect them to further reduce EV prices to stimulate demand. Either way the death of ICE vehicles is just beginning and Tesla has 91% of untapped US market share. 

Secondly, despite what Reddit has you believe Cyber truck demand is strong. Elon reported to shareholders that there is a year long backlog of cyber truck orders and he expects production to ramp in 2024. No one knows what Cyber Trucks margins will be but we can expect them to be better than other models due to experience but also due to the fact that the cyber truck uses 48v and will have significantly less copper than standard 12v cars. 

Finally I know there have been a lot of empty FSD promises but version 12 of FSD truly is different and is a step change in progress toward realizing the next level of autonomy. For those of you that don't know version 12 for the first time utilizes AI from end to end. From image recognition to control and there is very clearly an observable difference which is why FSD version 12 beta is now free for one month. On top of this we can only expect FSD to rapidly improve now that the Tesla Dojo is operational. For those of you that don't know Tesla has created their own 7nm GPU with the help of poached AMD engineers. This Dojo computer will be one of the most powerful in the world by June and will be primarily focused on training Tesla's FSD. In the near term I think there is opportunity to surprise investors with a renewed interest in FSD. In the long term it looks as though Tesla will be positioned to make significant advancements on FSD and perhaps spinoff portions of the Dojo as a cloud computing service. 

TLDR: Tesla's price represents a period of EV weakness. Battery prices will fall significantly in 2024 making EVs cost competitive. Cyber truck production will ramp and FSD interest will grow with capability ",2024-03-29 02:25:51,2024-03-29 02:25:51+00:00

"DJT realized net gain of $1.2 million over the last 3 days , the journey to the moon is just the beginning üöÄüöÄüöÄ",6,1bqhclt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqhclt/djt_realized_net_gain_of_12_million_over_the_last/,3,1711689629.0,"My fellow degenerates/apes, KingKong's here, I don't like shit talk, as talk is cheap, that's why you seldom see my comment /post here. But when I move, it is going to be huge. Overcoming/ignoring the FUDders, mockers, and shit-talkers, my conviction on stock DJT has paid off, with a¬†realized¬†net gain of $1.2 million over the last 3 days.¬†

How I did it: Like you, I was searching for a rocket that could bring me to the moon ( like some of you, I jumped on the wrong rocket and it crashed on Earth miserably) During Covid plandemic, I was awakened by the reality of the lying mainstream media, censoring big techs, corrupt political establishments, evil globalists, deep state swamps and came to a conclusion and conviction that Trump and his company TMTG are the antidotes. I started accumulating its stocks, and then its warrants, when I anticipated the catalytic events, I loaded up its call options, especially this DWAC and TMTG merger on 03/26/24. I have taken profit of about half of my portfolio and will continue to accumulate DJT when it dips, as the journey to the moon is just the beginning, can you imagine where this rocket DJT will reach when Trump becomes the president of the United States again, the most powerful man on earth?¬† üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ)...buyer beware at current $25 price,6,1bqnakt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqnakt/destiny_tech100_dxyzbuyer_beware_at_current_25/,26,1711712899.0,"So I heard about this company Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) in one of the comment threads yesterday and it sounded real promising.  It invests in private tech companies (like SpaceX, OpenAI, Discord, etc.) before they're public.  Its shares started listing on the NYSE on Tuesday 3/26, opening at $8.25 and closing at $25.00 yesterday (3/28).  Since the markets are closed, decided to do some DD and dug into the company's SEC filings/prospectus.  

Bottom line:  buyer beware... at a $25 price, the company's $50 million portfolio needs to 5x for you to get to net asset value (fundamental-wise).  In this market though, I wouldn't be surprised if this thing rips (see DJT), so make your own decisions!  This is not financial advice.  I am a regard.

Details:

* It's a closed-end fund with assets of around $50M.  10.88M shareholders.  So net asset value per share is $4.60 per share.  Tuesday's listing was **not** an IPO where the $8.25 original price went to the company itself.  That money went to the person selling the shares (Prasad).
* It originally acquired its assets at a $75M cost, and the FMV of its assets is now about $50M.
* Annual management fee expenses of 2.5% of gross assets per year that goes to the founder's (Sohail Prasad) investment advisory LLC.  So $1.25 million out the door every year.
* Legal, audit, professionals etc. expenses of 2.5% this year.  Another $1.25 million out the door.
* The company has some cool names in its portfolio (SpaceX, Discord, OpenAI, etc.).  SpaceX makes up around $15M of its $50M porftolio.  Epic Games is $3M.  Discord is $0.3M.  OpenAI is $0.8M or something.
* So some of its investments could do incredible, but who knows which ones and when.  Let's say OpenAI is a 100 bagger that nets $80 million for the company.  That would mean a portfolio value of $130 million.  NAV would still be around $12 per share.  And if you bought at $25... well, still not great.

$DJT: The Play Has Only Just Begun,0,1bqnxcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqnxcc/djt_the_play_has_only_just_begun/,75,1711714886.0,"ATTENTION ALL REGARDS:

This DD is a continuation of the DJT play that was initially proposed in this post: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). (For the record, this is not a post just to pump my bags. I realized \~$7,500 on last week's move and have initiated new positions. I legitimately think this thing has a lot more room to run, particularly because that's the exact opposite of what everyone is expecting).

The thesis was sound:

1. A low float stock that can move significantly if volume comes in
2. A merger and a ticker change to generate media coverage and bring the volume in
3. A cult-like following with a track record of pouring their money into Donnie T related opportunities

The issue with this was the fixation on the 500 bagger. While DJT certainly could have tested it's ATH at $190 before 3/28, that was obviously not a likely outcome, especially when everyone was betting on it.

While, unfortunately the 500 bagger didn't play out, there is still good news. The move that we did get has now primed this stock for a perfect setup, potentially plowing through $80 and toward the $190 ATH. Longs are moping around with their worthless calls talking about how it was a ""good ride"" and shorts are already bragging about the easy tendies they are going to make from fading this POS company into oblivion.

The consensus is now that the play is dead in the water which is why this is the perfect opportunity to take the opposite side.

HEAR ME OUT:

1. Be patient with the MAGA crowd. The snail mail that boomers have been writing to their financial advisors instructing them to smash the fucking bid on DJT isn't going to arrive until next week. The blue-collar crew have been wanting to pile in but are still waiting on their bi-weekly pay check to hit. Give them time. They are a little slower moving than us degen gamblers, but rest assured, they are still making their way to the party.
2. This stock is majorly short-biased now. Borrow rate now at 600%: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqk2av/djt_short_borrow_rate_at_600/). Everyone is just assuming that this is a layup short and that Trump will dump his stock soon which is unlikely in my view. If this thing does not immediately plummet next week, bears are going to be shitting the bed.
3. In addition to the looming MAGA volume and the potential for upside down shorts, there will be massive FOMO from retail if we start to get a move to the upside. Traders that lost money on the initial run up or missed it entirely will stumbling over each other to get back in.
4. The stock is up like 100% in a week and has essentially just spent the last few days consolidating sideways ABOVE the local high of $58.72 from the previous spike in January. From a purely technical perspective, this doesn't really look like a one and done rally that is just going to dump infinitely from here. Dare I say the chart might even look a bit bullish?
5. FED was dovish last meeting. GDP print this week was strong yesterday. Rates have been gently coming down this week. Inflation ticking up a bit recently but not enough for anyone to actually take it seriously yet. Not that this is a macro-play at all, but I do think positive sentiment around the macro environment is a prerequisite for a move like this to take place.
6. **Easter Fucking Weekend.** What better way to spread the DJT word than via some familial chit chat over a lovely Easter Sunday meal. Devouring turkey and deviled eggs, celebrating the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, and a wee bit of hot stock gossip. I can already hear my Granny now, ""Should I buy me some of that Donald Trump stock?"" Yes, Granny. Yes, you should.

MY POSITIONS (will likely be adding Monday morning if all goes accordingly):

DISCLAIMER: Not investment advice. Do your own DD. No offense intended to any of the parties referenced in this post. I have much love and respect for everyone. Especially my Granny.

UPDATE 03/29/24: All-In Podcast discusses DJT at length [(link to clip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1001s). Chamath compares DJT to ""Bowie Bonds"" where people will be using it as a vehicle to invest in Trump's brand which will have a significantly different value placed on it than the revenues of a shitty social media company. David believes that many Trump supporters will buy the stock as a ""protest vote"". Lot of eyes on this podcast and they discuss the topic in a very serious manner. Honestly, think this is more than enough to fuel a gap up on Monday morning. Good luck to all.  


UPDATE 03/30/24: I am also long \~500k of the DJT crypto token [(link to token)](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x32a6047bded36b985534750a4292a35d5dbd4e5f?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults) which has seen a fair amount of buying throughout the weekend. Makes me hopeful that more and more attention is being allocated toward the ""Long Trump"" play. Excited for trading on the DJT stock to get going again. If we are gapping up on Monday morning, I will probably look to buy more calls for 4/5. If we are gapping down, will see how it holds up in the morning and assess from there. Good luck everyone.",2024-03-29 12:21:26,2024-03-29 12:21:26+00:00

2. FED was dovish last meeting. GDP print this week was strong yesterday. Rates have been gently coming down this week. Inflation ticking up a bit recently but not enough for anyone to actually take it seriously yet. Macro environment still seems ripe for stock moves that represent gargantuan premiums relative to their fundamentals.
3. Be patient with the MAGA crowd. The snail mail that boomers have been writing to their financial advisors instructing them to smash the fucking bid on DJT isn't going to arrive until next week. The blue-collar crew have been wanting to pile in but are still waiting on their bi-weekly pay check to hit. Give them time. They are a little slower moving than us degen gamblers, but they are making their way to the party.
4. This stock is majorly short-biased now. Borrow rate now at 600%: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqk2av/djt_short_borrow_rate_at_600/). Everyone just assuming that this is a layup short and that Trump will dump his stock which is unlikely in my view. If this thing does not immediately plummet next week, bears are going to be shitting the bed.
5. In addition to the looming MAGA volume and the potential for upside down shorts, there will be massive FOMO from retail if we start to get a move to the upside. Traders that lost money on the initial run up or missed it entirely will stumbling over each other to get back in.
6. **Easter Fucking Weekend.** What better way to generate interest in a hot stock than through familial chit chat over an Easter Sunday meal. Devouring turkey and deviled eggs, celebrating the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, and spreading the $DJT word. I can already hear my Granny now, ""Should I buy me some of that Donald Trump stock?"" Yes, Granny. Yes, you should.

This DD is a continuation of the play that was initially proposed in this post: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). (For the record, I am not just trying to pump my bags. I realized \~$7,500 on the initial trade. I legitimately believe this thing has more room to run and have initiated new positions based on that).

The thesis was sound:

1. A low float stock that can move significantly if volume comes in
2. A merger and a ticker change to generate media coverage and bring the volume in
3. A cult-like following with a track record of pouring their money into Donnie T related opportunities

The issue with this was the fixation on the 500 bagger. While $DJT certainly could have tested it's ATH at $190 before 3/28, that was obviously not a likely outcome, especially when everyone was betting on it.

While, unfortunately the 500 bagger didn't play out, there is still good news. The move that we did get has now primed this stock for a rally through $80 and toward the $190 ATH. Bulls are moping around with their worthless calls talking about how it was a ""good ride"" and bears are already bragging about the easy tendies they are going to make from fading this POS company into oblivion.

The consensus is now that the play is dead in the water which is why this is the perfect opportunity to take the opposite side.

"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? Try AAPL",364,1bqq2iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqq2iz/you_missed_meta_nflx_googl_try_aapl/,266,1711720999.0,"I think AAPL is an obvious play. It hasn't participated in this 2024 rally at all and is due for a catch-up play. Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  

AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.

The whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.

This whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.

My thoughts on $DJT,0,1bqq5fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqq5fs/my_thoughts_on_djt/,46,1711721210.0,"First of all, ‚ÄúTrump Media Company‚Äù or whatever its called Is a freaking joke. You know what else was a joke? I‚Äôll give you a hint, they just reported earnings this week. That stock was the only thing we‚Äôve seen that‚Äôs close to this shit. When it had its rally, it took 10 MONTHS to finally break out of the flat but volatile cesspool of degeneracy 30-40% from ATH. And still, years later it‚Äôs slowly creeping to the inevitable 0. 

Seeing that DJT is an equally worthless company with equal hype and even more questionable financial backing, this shit is gonna stick around for a few months. It may even see a new ATH in the next month, it may not. It‚Äôs an election year, hell, Trump might just use whatever money he has left or bribe some wealthy fund to keep it afloat until election month passes just so he has something positive to run his campaign on. 

Another thing, there‚Äôs no such thing as bad press. ‚ÄúTruth Social‚Äù has like 475k users, right?! Well, thanks to this fiasco, that number is gonna skyrocket. Thousands of degenerate gamblers, trolls, and owners of the $69.99 Trump Bible are gonna flock to the app just for shits and giggles. Then, when there‚Äôs 750k users in April, Trump is gonna brag like he‚Äôs Ben Shapiro right after his wife graduated medical school.

Bottom line, it‚Äôs not gonna tank to 0 immediately. It will, but not for a few months/years. It‚Äôs more likely to set new ATHs than it is for it to go down significantly before election season. The likeliest scenario in my mind is a dash down to roughly $40-$50, float there for a few months, and then, when nobody expects it, it will start its slow decent into death that will take 2-3 years. 

If you‚Äôre long now, you‚Äôre chasing a runaway train after it‚Äôs already left the station. If you‚Äôre short now, you‚Äôre too early in the game. And by too early I mean months too early. there‚Äôs no way Donald fucking Trump and his MAGA army are gonna let this stock fall before the elections. My plays going forward? I‚Äôm watching, but i‚Äôm probably not gonna touch this thing for 6, 7 or maybe 10 months, and then, if I‚Äôm right, once it‚Äôs worn out it‚Äôs welcome..

"Institutions already know PCE data one month before you, and the Report is already priced in by the time it drops - here's your proof",645,1bqth2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqth2o/institutions_already_know_pce_data_one_month/,165,1711729631.0,"Too many lil dipshits telling me I'm crazy for having this theory, so I took the time to break it down for those mongoloids.

We do not see the PCE report for the prior month until the end of the current month. On March 29, we only just now see February's PCE, but it is the end of March, and that subsequent report will already be just about finished. Institutions get to see those numbers weeks before us.

Here's your proof:

From July 28, 2023 through October 27, 2023, SPY dropped -$40.

From June 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, PCE stopped declining and ramped up hot at 3.198% to 3.37% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))

Keep those dates in mind, and follow along with daddy:

From May 2023 through June 2023, PCE DROPPED 3.96% to 3.19%. The June DROPPED PCE rate would have released to the public on July 28, 2023. This is precisely when SPY began bleeding out. At that time the bleeding began, it would have looked to Retail as though PCE was still cooling. However, at the time June PCE was being released to the public, July data was already in existence, and the July data was going to show that PCE was no longer cooling, and in fact was rising again.

You still with me? Let's fast-forward to the most recent climb, which began on October 26, 2023, which has preceded this most recent vertical line up.

On October 27, 2023, Retail was just getting the released September PCE readings. ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01))

As you may recall, September's PCE readings were STILL GOING UP. On October 27, 2023, the public would still be seeing a rise in PCE. However, weirdly, the market began shooting up.

Guess why...

Because the October data showed PCE significantly cooled from 3.37% to 2.95% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))

Weirdly, this cooling data from October was not available to the public until November 30, 2023, at which point SPY had already rebounded from $410 to $450.

&#x200B;

That's all. This isn't a conspiracy you clowns, this is real.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr, SPY price movements correlate perfectly with UNRELEASED PCE data, and contradicts the released data.

"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? The answer isn't AAPL, its actually UNH",0,1bqv3qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqv3qx/you_missed_meta_nflx_googl_the_answer_isnt_aapl/,9,1711733665.0,"UNH is an obvious play. Its basically been flat for 2 years now, and the recent cyberattack nonsense will likely pass. The other issue is DOJ, but in my view its just noise. The ship sailed a generation ago since Kaiser Permanente has been doing the same thing UNH is with Optum forever. Good luck trying to un-fuk the US healthcare system. To really drive this home, so far UNH has spent $10mm+ lobbying (top 50) and while DOJ is not congress, let's not pretend congress doesn't put pressure on the DOJ.  Good luck trying to un-fuk the US healthcare system.

This thing has been a beast of a compounder for a decade that has silently performed better than GOOG/GOOGL since March of 2014 (10 year total returns), returning 21.5% annualized vs 18.5% for GOOG - with way less volatility (this means options are cheap for those who can't connect the dots).

UNH is trading at \~15x NTM FCF, a discount to \~20x NTM FCF it has traded historically over last 5 years.   For those who don't care about FCF, trading at 17x NTM PE while market is trading at 23x+ NTM PE.

This thing likely rerates to 20x NTM FCF in 12 months if not sooner and with $34 of FCF/Share by end of 2025 we are talking about $650+ stock within 12-16 months.  

Now, I'm not usually one for OTM calls, but check out my position below (IV less than 25% on these). Thinking about tossing in some call spreads in the high 500s for that extra juice. I like to avoid theta decay as much as possible.

Recently this week alone I deposited in about $800 SGD = $550ish USD on Tuesday and managed to get it to about $1500 USD which I'm insanely proud off.

When next Monday opens, I was initally thinking of shorting NVDA as I still believed its overpriced and might come down a lot, but recently I meant in the last 10 mins, I looked through 2023's Start of Q2, Q3 and Q4 and NVDA shot up a lot in the first day, as my strategy for options is no matter how long the DTE is i'll preferably sell the option on the same day to ensure theta dont ruin me.

So since only the only option that is avaible within my budget is a 1 week option of $1500 USD (Strike price of $895 current stock price is $902), y'all reckon following the trend is a good strategy as I predict that there will still be a sell off in the beginning then a $20 gain (Hopefully)

I know that this will essentially be my entire portfolio so fuck it right, im still young and my Finance teacher's been doubting my abilities to make a 10 baggers gotta prove him WRONG!!!

So a $20 gain in NVDA if i get a good entry price this will likely give me a 3.5x of my $1500, i'm not rich by any metrics and if done properly I'll donate $100 to the old people playing harmonica and selling tissues by the train stations promise, to the moon we GO!?!?!?

Firstly, Tim had some issues in China even in 2018 (the first great revenue decline), but let's say Apple [resolved it](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement). Secondly, Xiaomi released their EVs, which was Apple dream for years, but eventually failed.

Personally I think that China could be great opportunity for Apple but since China is really problematic market for the US in general, I'm just wondering when Apple would leave it at all?

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

Yes, this is Vlad the Impaler :) Here's my YOLO position in one of the most innovative fintech companies. A few things I believe to kick things off: (1) There are few golden / universal rules in gambling, and screenshot to close is not one of them lol. (2) I don't know everything, and it's awesome. I've been riding this stock since Q2 2023, switched to options late 23, then went even harder into options early 24. I'm long on the intrinsic value of the company, so I put my money where my mouth is.

Here's my DD:

* Last quarter RH reported profits to the surprise of the entire market who projected them losing money (beat expectations by 21x in some instances). Half of revenue came from interest earnings, which again, was to the surprise of Wall Street bc ppl still see this as a meme company that only makes money from regarded option plays, like mine. Read any article and few point this out.
* Revenue is diversifying and assets under management is spiking. The high interest rate environment promotes this trend. RH offers high-yield 5% checking accounts. Just park your money there and you earn, and they earn from the arbitrage. Banks are ripping millions of ppl off with .025% savings rates, so I see a lot of growth opportunities here. IDK why laymen don't understand that FDIC secured means FDIC secured, regardless of the institution/bank holding the bag.
* RH announced credit card and to no surprise, Wall Street is still offsides here, because no one is reporting on the innovation being built in partnership with VISA, THE VISA. Here's the quick summary: RH credit cards will allow you to create / destroy unlimited virtual cards, so you can sign up to unlimited free trials, gym memberships, etc and cancel the virtual card if the service provider is lame or gets pesky.
* I totally respect r/wsb, but you regarded dudes still hate this company for the wrong reasons. They did not collude with citadel.

IDK why laymen don't understand that FDIC secured means FDIC secured, regardless of the institution/bank holding the bag.
* RH announced credit card and to no surprise, Wall Street is still offsides here, because no one is reporting on the innovation being built in partnership with VISA, THE VISA.

EDIT:

Estimates from analysts/experts are for deliveries, not production. So for 423k produced, deliveries will be even less.

Factoring in the weekend, I‚Äôll revise my estimate to 423-433k produced, and 410-420k delivered.

Also, it‚Äôs possible (but in my opinion unlikely) that the 6M milestone was reached at an earlier date than today, which would make all these estimates false.

I am starting to think the options trading I see here is not the best way. Here is my other idea. Let me know what you think.

Find a momentum stock like [$VRT](https://ibb.co/MNfJS1j) that you think will continue ripping upward. If you don't like this stock, fine, pick a different one. Buy 100 shares. Then, buy 1 put ATM with an expiration date somewhat far enough in the future, 3-6-9 months. Now, normally when I buy a momentum stock, it tanks mercilessly as soon as I buy it. But this time I have a put, so my losses are limited to the cost of the put. If my long stock postion gains more than the cost of the put, I make sweet profit. If it tanks, I exercise my put, and turn the put writer into a WSB bagholder. Obviously this will only deliver big gains if the stock continues on its parabolic trajectory, but if it doesn't, my losses are limited.

For this stock, the 112 day put is about 10% of the share price, but the stock has been gaining more than 10% over that previous time period. 

Has anyone ever thought of this before? Am I regarded? Do people do this?

Alright folks, let‚Äôs dive deep without the fluff. Jerome Powell just lit up the stage with insights that resonate with anyone who‚Äôs spent more than a minute dissecting the intertwining of tech and economic fate. This isn‚Äôt about piecing together fragmented insights; it‚Äôs a panoramic view, and Powell‚Äôs holding the lens.

**No Beating Around the Bush - Here‚Äôs What Powell Laid Out:**

**Economic Resilience**: The U.S. economy? It‚Äôs on steroids, showing a kind of bounce-back that's nothing short of legendary. Powell isn't just tipping his hat; he‚Äôs underlining the brute strength that‚Äôs propelling us into tomorrow.

**Inflation‚Äôs Tightrope**: Inflation's that annoying itch you can‚Äôt scratch away. Watching Powell navigate this is akin to seeing a tightrope walker juggling fire. He‚Äôs crafting a master plan to keep the economy's heat just right - warm enough for growth but cool enough to dodge a burn.

**The New Work Order**: Gone are the days of the 9-5 grind being the norm. Remote work and the gig economy are shaking the foundations, and Powell's eyes are wide open to these seismic shifts reshaping the job landscape.

**A World Tied Together**: Our economic destiny isn‚Äôt just ours to write; the global stage plays a pivotal role. Powell‚Äôs gaze extends beyond our borders, recognizing that our economic ship sails on international waters.

**Anchoring Stability**: Amidst the storm, financial stability remains the North Star. Powell and his band are all hands on deck, ensuring the financial system stays robust, serving as the economy's backbone.

## The Tech Juggernaut Takes the Wheel

"Naked AMC Puts, really?! WOW!...",0,1br3cau,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br3cau/naked_amc_puts_really_wow/,9,1711756087.0,"You can always buy a put lower in strike price or a call hiring strike price. It's your insurance in case you f it all up. Very much worth it, especially on a stock that you know is going to be jumping like a jaguar.

Think like a FIDUCIARY! Assess your Risk. It's only a Casino if you treat it like that. 
If you think it's really going to move, and let's say the stock is $100, sell a $100 put, and buy 2 $99puts. And then compare the total to a $98put and see what's better for your risk tolerance.  

And if it's so much $$$$ from selling that it seems to good to be true, chances are it is check the IV. 

Or at least buy the LEAPS on it, and then just keep selling weeklys. Make it into a bank. A more secure bank. Of course that has risks as well, but are much less than selling naked. And then you won't be up the S Creek without a paddle.

I would be so incredibly depressed if I lost $900k, or even 5% in a day.
I would study, learn, and perfect your craft.

If you are an impulsive shopper, don't naked anything!

I saw one recently - There's a project out there that seeks to allow investment firms to use AI data to make better decisions with regards to acquiring and selling other companies, including start-ups.
