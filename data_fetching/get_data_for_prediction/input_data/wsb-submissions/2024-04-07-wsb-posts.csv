Selling a Stonks jacket - what better use of your gains?,2,1bxsk0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxsk0v/selling_a_stonks_jacket_what_better_use_of_your/,1,1712454733.0,"Hello my fellow well-regarded [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) denizens,

Alas, I have fallen on hard times: YOLO'ed it all on DWAC and TSLA calls while shorting NVDA and SPY, and now my wife's boyfriend is going to start charging me rent. So, I am trying to offload my one-of-a-kind (OK there may be \~10 others out there) Stonks puffy jacket, size L. For reference, see the photo of me wearing it: I claimed to be 6'4"" on Tinder (more like 6'1), so do your due diligence and size accordingly. If you are tired of your VC buddies flexing their Patagucci swag, this item is for you.

Pros:

* Synthetically derived (see what I did there?) filling means it stays warm even when wet, so when your mortgage the house and lose you can stay warm on the streets.
* It has a WSB guy riding on a rocket ship.
* It says ""STONKS"" in big letters on the arm.
* It's made by the North Face so it says ""The North Face"" like a hundred times.
* It looks and performs at least twice as good as a trash bag.
* Stonks only go up.

Cons:

* I flew too close to the sun so there's a small taped-over burn on one sleeve.
* I only have the one.

Accepting any reasonable offers in the neighborhood of enough to pay off my margin loans. DM me if you're interested.

They are all laborers, how can the economy be bad?

There will be more illegal immigrants in 2024, and the gross estimate may be close to 5 million. If Joe is re-elected, it is estimated that this trend will continue.

Although the economy is booming, however illegal immigrants have low wages and don't take up social welfare. Maybe the inflation that the Fed is concerned about will drop to 2%, so it will cut interest rates 2-3 times this year.

It is possible to see continued economic growth, low inflation, and  lower interest rates. US stocks are slowly up, US dollars are strong, US bonds are slowly up.",2024-04-07 06:29:04,2024-04-07 06:29:04+00:00

RIVN is undervalued and it's LEAPS aren't priced in,0,1bxyp75,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxyp75/rivn_is_undervalued_and_its_leaps_arent_priced_in/,247,1712475582.0,"Due to my unextensive research I believe that RIVN is going to absolutely print in the long run. After IPO, the stock immediatly tanked, with most investors believing that the stock was overvalued. Common reasons for this were that the company is still largely in the investment stage, and despite having a product in the hands of consumers, is still not profitable. With a net income of -5.4b in 2023, the company definetly still has a long way to go, no doubt about it, and most investors rightfully decided to leave the stock alone.  


That being said, the value of the company should not be determined by its current value, but by its potential. It is an ""investment"" after all. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, a new line of vehicles, and EVs taking over, this sentiment will surely change. Most people acknowledge that Rivian will almost certainly take a huge market share in the future, but because that is such a distant prospect, and because the stock's lifetime graph is so pathetic, I beleive that Rivian's price is not only the lowest it will probably ever be (not specifically *now,* but in general. I don't see it ever sitting in the tens after 2030), but that Rivian's potential to breach its IPO within the next few years is not priced in at all.  


In short, Rivian's stock value and options pricing are a response to aggressive short term trading and panic, and not indicitive of long term investment. This is the dip.  


It would be absolutely unrealistic to assume that RIVN will breach it's IPO price within the next 2 years, but it will very likely double as R2 and R3 roll out. 5-8 years I am very optimistically bullish. and believe that it can break it's IPO. Deep ITM and OTM 2yr LEAPS can't go tits up, and the OTM LEAPS can always be rolled into new OTM LEAPS every 6 months to avoid theta decay.",2024-04-07 07:39:42,2024-04-07 07:39:42+00:00

$MUR- this company is an American named company called Murphy oil. They are based in Texas and have their hands in a bunch of countries and oil rigs out of reach from Americas enemies. 

WHY IS IRAN A PROBLEM- iran is extremely close to the Persian gulf where companies like PAA are extracting a lot of oil. If Iran wanted to attack America and deliver a heavy hit then they would attack oil which is right around the block for them. 

WHY $MUR IS SAFE- MUR is out of reach and has its hands in America‚Äôs, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, vietnam, and east africa. They have their hands in extremely large deposits of natural gas

MUR COMPANY PREFORMACE 

-lowered debt by 500 million from 1.8 billion to 1.3 billion in 2023

-repurchased 150 million dollars worth of stock 

-increased annual dividend by 9% 

-archived 139% oil reserve replenishment ratio( MUR gained 39% oil last year while continuing to pump oil) 

- has a good debt to equity ratio sitting at 2.15% coming in lower than PAA‚Äôs ratio of 5%

THE FUTURE OF OIL- oil will go up this summer. The rising inflation is pumping oil prices to the sky and it‚Äôs looking like it won‚Äôt stop. None of us really knows the risk that Iran causes oil drilling in the east but after Iran threatened to strike America back this means a whole new level of risk. Crude oil is in extreme demand since Russian oil has been eliminated and American company‚Äôs are seizing the opportunity by pumping as much as they can. 

What is my plan, I‚Äôm sitting this stupid red folder week out unless I see that oil isn‚Äôt effected by this stock manipulation that we all accept as red folder news. I will be buying long dated calls and monthly calls to generate profit which I can re invest and reduce risk but also have some sort of recurring profit since oil will continue to pump. The play really is to ride this oil surge to the top.

Let me know what you guys think, I wanna hear talks opinions and your own research. and I‚Äôm not saying PAA is a bad investment there could be safer options. ",2024-04-07 15:38:20,2024-04-07 15:38:20+00:00

So $GOLD is the largest gold mining company in the world, with a $31.35B market  cap and $11.397B in revenue last year that's 3.49% increase from 2022 , and their revenue for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 was¬†$2.862B, a¬†13.26% increase¬†year-over-year, And this is their best quarter since 2021.
Earnings is scheduled for may 1st, with strong EPS history the next earnings call would be very promising. 
The stock price is at $17.86 which has increased 15% in the last month but still -1.27% YTD. i think the targed price here is $20.

$MSTR is 24% shorted right now,350,1byeai0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byeai0/mstr_is_24_shorted_right_now/,197,1712521317.0,"That is, 24 percent of Microstrategy's floating stock is shorted. This sets up well for a squeeze. Bitcoin is currently surging, mainly due to the news that Coinbase has been absolved of it's [SEC lawsuit.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-cleared-in-lawsuit-over-crypto-transactions) Add to that:

&#x200B;

* BTC halving will occur sometime in the next two weeks, potentially driving up the price of BTC substantially in the short term. MSTR's book value is inherently tied to the cost of BTC, due to Micheal Saylor buying shitton's of coins to put in the companies treasury over the last two years. Over 92% of all the BTC that will ever be mined has already been mined, making it a scarce asset, about to become more scarce.
* On friday, MSTR faced one of the largest pullbacks in the stock's history, making the price a discount to where it was trading previously.
* Microstrategy's biggest day(+33%) came on a monday in which BTC had pumped the Sunday before hand and into Monday

&#x200B;

So, if futures a solid green tonight, and BTC stays above 69k into the morning, MSTR could see signifanct buying volume in the morning. If it gets large enough, it could force shortsellers to buy back their position, at which point a squeeze cycle would begin. On MSTR's best day, the stock price saw a gain of 21%, or $333 per share.  


Obviously, we dont know what will happen. Microstrategy has been trending down for the last week, and could continue to. I'm just saying the possibility is there, and this may be one to keep an eye on, at  least in the shortterm.",2024-04-07 20:21:57,2024-04-07 20:21:57+00:00

Buying puts on the Dow?,1,1byhwuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byhwuk/buying_puts_on_the_dow/,7,1712530142.0,"I wanted to see what people's thoughts were on shorting the Dow Jones by buying long dated put options.

I think there will be a downturn of about 30-50% and maybe more. 

I believe this due to the following:

- High interest rates meaning higher borrowing cost for business. 
- Large companies looking at reducing their workforces.
- High inflation caused by government borrowing and printing more money and running a deficit.
- Confrence board index is signifying a downturn
- Reduced saving and higher credit card balances for the general population.
- ongoing wars and the potential for this spreading.

I'm sure there is a lot that I've missed, but wanted to get people's thoughts on areas I may have not considered.",2024-04-07 22:49:02,2024-04-07 22:49:02+00:00
