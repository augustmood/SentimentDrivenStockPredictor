NVDA Spread update,1000,1bsq8l9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bsq8l9,164,1711932635.0,"
This is an update from my previous post [‚ÄúAnyone ever gotten this?‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/SOSGImr0kf) 

First, here's the rundown of what happened: So, I had this genius plan to score an ""easy"" $500 by dealing with NVDA options. I sold 10 calls at the $902.5 strike for $2.75 each and hedged with 10 call contracts at the $900 strike that I got for $4.75. Quick math: that's a breakeven at $902, selling for $902.5, netting me a sweet $0.50 per share. 

But here's the kicker, I didn't know you could call your broker until 5:30 PM if your option expires in the money. Long story short, the buyer of my $902.5 strike calls ghosted, leaving me with 1000 shares of NVDA from the expired $900 strike calls and a cash account deficit of $897,813.87. Which is some RH BS because the shares were worth $901,250, but still stressful AF. 

I wasn't thrilled about being on the hook for $1000 for every $1 move in NVDA. But Robinhood's 24-hour market came in clutch. I unloaded those shares on Sunday night at $909.62 a pop, raking in a profit of $7.62 per stock. I probably could have made more if I held but I‚Äôm relieved I‚Äôm out. Crisis averted, tendies secured. üöÄüí∞ü§ë

TLDR: Robinhood told me I owed them almost $900k after I did an NVDA spread without knowing about DNE, so I almost got spread, but got lucky and ended up making $7k or 350% in four days.",2024-04-01 00:50:35,2024-04-01 00:50:35+00:00

Perhaps this is a high-ass question ... but ... what are the chances an AI has been turned on somewhere that has broken the market?,423,1bstnqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bstnqg/perhaps_this_is_a_highass_question_but_what_are/,299,1711942756.0,"Just something that I have been pondering recently.

Here, me out. What if we are not in a bubble, but the beginning of an actual infinite money glitch.

 If its logical to assume the AI we have access to today is a fraction of what they have access to. What are the chances, some big bank or hedgy has put something into their ""black boxes"" that essentially manipulates foreign markets and transports the wealth Stateside, reinvesting it here. 

There is no way, a company has created this, and not first found an application in the financial sector ... I mean, right? I feel like the fact that we even have access now, means the starting pistol must have gone off ages ago ... or?

It should be noted, I have been using AI extensively lately, and how seamlessly it has integrated into my life, and in turn changed my creative process and professional strategy has broken me. There is no way some of the things I have used it for, have not been more complicated than markets. Not to say it is required of me to do my job, but for a machine to act as my number 2, and at times with damn life-like feeling intuition, leads me to *feel* there is no way it isn't on ...

It should also be noted, I am a certified moron.

0DTE Calls on SPY for the next year? If the overall trend was positive, would this not print? I have only recently after 6 years of heavy investing and a lot of hard lessons learned, begun to feel confident enough, to play with my spare change.

The biggest options position of my life but scared money makes no money and you got to buy when there is blood on the streets. Not financial advice assuming you degens will do detailed research

**Downside:**

* Stock is heavily shorted and targets by shorts. SI is 76%
* It is shorted to shits for a reason. Company is accused of fraud, linked to a known fraudster Kahn and is super delayed on its 10K, a red flag. Clearly it is not all roses
* Real chance this can go to zero if company never submits a 10k or changes their numbers materially

**Why did I still YOLO**

* Well this sub is not called valuw investing. Taking Bets is part of the game and risk
* Fair value of this company is $50-70. It was around this price before the shorts attacked them. Currently It is at $21
* Few positive catalysts in the last few weeks
* While company is delayed in it‚Äôs 10k it clearly said they don‚Äôt expect any material changes to its numbers
* Filing last week stating they have agreed to an extension with their lenders and will submit the audited 10k report latest by April 29th. So now we have a clear deadline
* The above two are both in their public filing
* Well SI is 76%, one of the highest in the market, if things come out clean, a squeeze can be a real bonus here and short term who knows what happens. Again, this all depends on the 10K. But currently no shares to borrow, CTB 90% and Utilization 99%.

**TLDR** ‚Äì Company accused of fraud, shorted to shits , can go to zero, but trading well below fair value, can easily spike up on audited clean financials and a squeeze can be a bonus.

$CPRX Catalyst Pharmaceuticals Good Value,4,1bt5gag,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bt5gag/cprx_catalyst_pharmaceuticals_good_value/,3,1711982404.0,"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. $CPRX is a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for rare neurological diseases. The company's flagship product, Firdapse (amifampridine), has received approval for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in the United States.

Market Potential: Catalyst Pharmaceuticals operates in a niche market focusing on rare neurological diseases. The prevalence of such diseases and the limited treatment options available present a significant market opportunity for the company.

FDA Approval and Commercialization: Firdapse has been granted FDA approval for the treatment of LEMS, which provides Catalyst Pharmaceuticals with a competitive advantage in the market. The company has initiated commercialization efforts, indicating potential revenue growth in the foreseeable future.

Financial Performance: Reviewing Catalyst Pharmaceuticals' financial performance provides insights into its stability and growth potential. As of the last several quarterly reports, the company has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, with revenue increasing by 82% in the most recent. Additionally, the company has maintained a healthy cash position with free cash flow increasing YoY since 2019 and manageable debt levels that includes a cash-to-debt ratio of 38:1, indicating financial stability.

Development: Beyond Firdapse, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has a promising pipeline of potential therapies targeting other rare neurological disorders. The advancement of these pipeline candidates could further diversify the company's revenue streams and strengthen its position in the market.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Ratings: Monitoring investor sentiment and analyst ratings can provide additional insights into market expectations and potential price movements. Analyzing recent trends in analyst coverage and consensus price targets can help assess the stock's perceived value by market professionals.

Financial Data Support:

Revenue Growth: Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has consistently reported revenue growth over the past few years, +16.3% 2020, +18.2% 2021, +52.1% 2022, and +85.9% 2023, indicating strong demand for its products. The company's revenue for the last reported quarter was $398.2 million, representing roughly an 82% increase compared to the same period last year.

Profitability: Conducting a profitability analysis can provide insights into the company's ability to generate profits from its operations. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has reported positive net income in recent quarters, reflecting its ability to effectively manage costs and generate returns for shareholders. EBITDA is an alternate measure of profitability to net income, and it can be a useful way to measure how efficiently a company is operating. Analyzing $CPRX‚Äôs last three years, when compared to the previous, you will see the company is operating efficiently: +27% 202, +96% 2022, +16.1% 2023

Balance Sheet Strength: Examining Catalyst Pharmaceuticals' balance sheet can assess its financial health and liquidity position. As of the last reported quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $137.6 million and total debt of $3.5 million. The company's healthy cash position and manageable debt levels indicate financial stability and flexibility to support its growth initiatives.

Cash Flow Analysis: Analyzing the company's cash flow statement can provide insights into its ability to generate cash from its core operations, invest in growth opportunities, and return value to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has maintained positive operating cash flow, with the most previous quarter reflecting $61.8 million in free cash flow and last three annual reports reflecting YoY increase of +59.3% 2021, +116% 2022, +61.8% 2023, demonstrating its ability to generate cash from its business activities.

Earnings Call: While three of the last four earnings calls have been consensus misses, each earnings call has improved from the previous with the most recent earnings call a beat. The next earning call is scheduled for May 8th.",2024-04-01 14:40:04,2024-04-01 14:40:04+00:00

Let‚Äôs start by looking at the popular opinions on $DJT that are making the rounds.

Bear:

- Trump Media & Technology Group does not have the fundamentals to justify its current evaluation.

- This stock is largely dependent on a single individual, Donald Trump, who is undergoing a litany of legal cases. These cases will force him to loan or sell shares of $DJT, which would likely sink the share price.

- The price is current at $60.00?! Everyone will definitely sell and I‚Äôm going to make a killing on the downfall.

Bull:

- This is Donald Trump‚Äôs company? He wants to restore free speech? I want to be a part of this, so I‚Äôm gonna buy shares.

- Donald Trump‚Äôs company just went public? This guy is the world‚Äôs #1 self-promotor & people are going to go crazy for this. I‚Äôm in.

- The price is currently at $60.00?! I can get in early and in 10 years this thing will go 10x

Like everything that relates to Donald Trump. $DJT is polarizing subject. Some would relish in seeing this thing completely and utterly fail, while others hope to see this truly succeed.

So why does this matter? If you happen to be in the I don‚Äôt GAF camp, I‚Äôm just here to make money. Then here‚Äôs why it matters, the politics of this stock has created a massive short squeeze opportunity the likes we haven‚Äôt seen since the stock who shall not be named (... ""we like the stock"").

Let‚Äôs take a look, starting with the most recent ORTEX data:

[SI Overview](https://preview.redd.it/k1hn3qhqqvrc1.png?width=3584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7dbf15c7638766bc500d7d8f049bc133ac4a0d)

#1 the Short interest value is $278.73 million.
#2 the Cost to Borrow is at 342.71%.

For those who don‚Äôt follow this kind of thing, most stocks, especially those that are widely held and traded have a relatively low cost to borrow rate, often below 5%. Stocks that are in high demand for shorting, have limited availability, or are perceived as having higher risk may have significantly higher borrowing costs. Rates above 20% are generally considered high and indicate a particular set of circumstances that makes shorting those stocks more expensive. 290.65% annual borrowing cost is far outside the norm, It suggests an exceptionally high demand to short the stock, combined with a very limited supply of shares to borrow. Here‚Äôs where things get interesting‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs take a look at how much shorts are spending daily with these numbers:

(SI \* CTB) / days per year = cost per day.

#($278,730,000 \* 342.71%) / 365 = $2,617,083 per day the shorts are paying to borrow & short $DJT!

How did shorts do lasts week with these high rates and high demand for $DJT?

*Processing img 7rj9qlkubwrc1...*

They took a $95 million loss, lol!

So what are shorts doing now? Are they running for the hills? Are they declaring defeat?

*Processing img anagfj98cwrc1...*


Nope‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre doubling down. Last Thursday they borrowed over 879k shares at a borrow rate of \~ 600+%!!!

Which brings up the question. What are the shorts betting on?

It‚Äôs simple, the shorts are betting that they can get shareholders to sell based off the fundamentals of $DJT. Is this company making money? Is it worth the current valuation? The answer is no and no one would hold after acquiring these gains, right?

What they aren‚Äôt realizing here is Trump supporters are holding $DJT. The same people who after 2 impeachments, 4 indictments, Jan 6th, ‚ÄúGrab em‚Äô by the p\*\*\*\*‚Äù, $DWAC SEC investigations, <insert random scandal here>, aren‚Äôt leaving his side. They are still buying his $400 shoes [for over $450,000](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-sneakers-ebay-profits-1872111), buying 110,000 of his [$100 ‚ÄúTrump baseball cards‚Äù](https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards), and more than anything, still voting for him. These people would march through the gates of hell for Trump and would die before selling their shares. The shorts are GROSSLY underestimating to what lengths these people will go for Donald Trump.

This brings us to the crux of the situation. The shorts need to keep the price down and are throwing the kitchen sink at it. If they can‚Äôt, they will be forced to cover 4.5 million shares worth at whatever price the holders deem their shares are worth. All this while it‚Äôs costing the shorts $2,617,083 dollars per day to keep this going & it costs $DJT holders nothing. It‚Äôs quite clear which side can outlast the other in this situation.

That‚Äôs all I have to share for now. I hold $DJT shares and options. Obviously the squeeze would become more likely if investors buy shares in addition to options. Feel free to double check and correct any of my info. Good luck to everyone no matter what side you fall on. Hopefully we all can make some money on this.

A Short's Dream Or Nightmare? üí≠,1186,1bt5jgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bt5jgb/a_shorts_dream_or_nightmare/,490,1711982614.0,"**04/02 Update:**

Let‚Äôs start by looking at the popular opinions on $DJT that are making the rounds.

Bear:

- Trump Media & Technology Group does not have the fundamentals to justify its current evaluation.

- This stock is largely dependent on a single individual, Donald Trump, who is undergoing a litany of legal cases. These cases will force him to loan or sell shares of $DJT, which would likely sink the share price.

- The price is current at $60.00?! Everyone will definitely sell and I‚Äôm going to make a killing on the downfall.

Bull:

- This is Donald Trump‚Äôs company? He wants to restore free speech? I want to be a part of this, so I‚Äôm gonna buy shares.

- Donald Trump‚Äôs company just went public? This guy is the world‚Äôs #1 self-promotor & people are going to go crazy for this. I‚Äôm in.

- The price is currently at $60.00?! I can get in early and in 10 years this thing will go 10x

Like everything that relates to Donald Trump. $DJT is polarizing subject. Some would relish in seeing this thing completely and utterly fail, while others hope to see this truly succeed.

So why does this matter? If you happen to be in the I don‚Äôt GAF camp, I‚Äôm just here to make money.

A Short's Dream Or Nightmare? üí≠,31,1bt5jgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bt5jgb/a_shorts_dream_or_nightmare/,10,1711982614.0,"Let‚Äôs start by looking at the popular opinions on $DJT that are making the rounds.

Bear:

\- Trump Media & Technology Group does not have the fundamentals to justify its current evaluation.

\- This stock is largely dependent on a single individual, Donald Trump, who is undergoing a litany of legal cases. These cases will force him to loan or sell shares of $DJT, which would likely sink the share price.

\- The price is current at $60.00?! Everyone will definitely sell and I‚Äôm going to make a killing on the downfall.

Bull:

\- This is Donald Trump‚Äôs company? He wants to restore free speech? I want to be a part of this, so I‚Äôm gonna buy shares.

\- Donald Trump‚Äôs company just went public? This guy is the world‚Äôs #1 self-promotor & people are going to go crazy for this. I‚Äôm in.

\- The price is currently at $60.00?! I can get in early and in 10 years this thing will go 10x

Like everything that relates to Donald Trump. $DJT is polarizing subject. Some would relish in seeing this thing completely and utterly fail, while others hope to see this truly succeed. 

So why does this matter? If you happen to be in the I don‚Äôt GAF camp, I‚Äôm just here to make money. Then here‚Äôs why it matters, the politics of this stock has created a massive short squeeze opportunity the likes we haven‚Äôt seen since the stock who shall not be named (... ""we like the stock"").

Let‚Äôs take a look, starting with the most recent ORTEX data:

&#x200B;

[SI Overview](https://preview.redd.it/k1hn3qhqqvrc1.png?width=3584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7dbf15c7638766bc500d7d8f049bc133ac4a0d)

\#1 the Short interest value is $278.73 million. #2 the Cost to Borrow is at 342.71%. 

For those who don‚Äôt follow this kind of thing, most stocks, especially those that are widely held and traded have a relatively low cost to borrow rate, often below 5%. Stocks that are in high demand for shorting, have limited availability, or are perceived as having higher risk may have significantly higher borrowing costs. Rates above 20% are generally considered high and indicate a particular set of circumstances that makes shorting those stocks more expensive. 290.65% annual borrowing cost is far outside the norm, It suggests an exceptionally high demand to short the stock, combined with a very limited supply of shares to borrow. Here‚Äôs where things get interesting‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs take a look at how much shorts are spending daily with these numbers:

(SI \* CTB) / days per year = cost per day.

($278,730,000 \* 342.71%) / 365 = $2,617,083 perer day the shorts are paying to borrow & short $DJT!

How did shorts do lasts week with these high rates and high demand for $DJT?

They took a $95 million loss, lol!

So what are shorts doing now? Are they running for the hills? Are they declaring defeat?

[Live SI](https://preview.redd.it/yu8qqyixqvrc1.png?width=3578&format=png&auto=webp&s=144001e530b342a57f88653810fcac4bf8b6974f)

Nope‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre doubling down. Last Thursday they borrowed over 879k shares at a borrow rate of \~ 600+%!!! 

Which brings up the question. What are the shorts betting on?

It‚Äôs simple, the shorts are betting that they can get shareholders to sell based off the fundamentals of $DJT. Is this company making money? Is it worth the current valuation? The answer is no and no one would hold after acquiring these gains, right?

What they aren‚Äôt realizing here is Trump supporters are holding $DJT. The same people who after 2 impeachments, 4 indictments, Jan 6th, ‚ÄúGrab em‚Äô by the p\*\*\*\*‚Äù, $DWAC SEC investigations, <insert random scandal here>, aren‚Äôt leaving his side. They are still buying his $400 shoes [for over $450,000](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-sneakers-ebay-profits-1872111), buying 110,000 of his [$100 ‚ÄúTrump baseball cards‚Äù](https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards), and more than anything, still voting for him. These people would march through the gates of hell for Trump and would die before selling their shares. The shorts are GROSSLY underestimating to what lengths these people will go for Donald Trump.

This brings us to the crux of the situation. The shorts need to keep the price down and are throwing the kitchen sink at it. If they can‚Äôt, they will be forced to cover 4.5 million shares worth at whatever price the holders deem their shares are worth. All this while it‚Äôs costing the shorts $2,617,083 dollars per day to keep this going & it costs $DJT holders nothing. It‚Äôs quite clear which side can outlast the other in this situation.

That‚Äôs all I have to share for now. I hold $DJT shares and options. Obviously the squeeze would become more likely if investors buy shares in addition to options. Feel free to double check and correct any of my info. Good luck to everyone no matter what side you fall on. Hopefully we all can make some money on this.

YOLO DD: SKYNET,2,1bt6qbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bt6qbn/yolo_dd_skynet/,7,1711985373.0,"Listen up because we're about to discuss why SKYNET is not just a meme, but a serious investment opportunity, especially with Judgement Day on the horizon.

AI Supremacy: SKYNET isn't your run-of-the-mill AI; it's the pinnacle of artificial intelligence. As we approach Judgement Day, the AI takeover event, SKYNET's potential to dominate various industries becomes even more relevant. Whether it's autonomous vehicles, predictive analytics, or cybersecurity, SKYNET's advanced AI technology positions it as a leader in the tech revolution.

Defense Contracts Pre-Judgement Day: Governments worldwide are ramping up defense spending in anticipation of potential threats, including the looming possibility of AI becoming self-aware. SKYNET's origins in military applications make it a prime candidate for securing lucrative defense contracts. As tensions escalate and nations prepare for the unknown, SKYNET could see a surge in demand for its cutting-edge technology.

Post-Judgement Day Survival: Now, I know what you're thinking: ""But won't SKYNET lead to humanity's downfall?"" While the risks are certainly there, savvy investors know how to turn a potential apocalypse into profit. In a post-Judgement Day scenario, SKYNET's technology could be crucial for survival. Think about it ‚Äì advanced AI for resource management, robotics for rebuilding infrastructure, and cybersecurity to fend off rogue machines. Investing in SKYNET now could position you for success in the aftermath of the apocalypse.

Space Exploration and Colonization: As humanity faces the prospect of extinction, the race to colonize other planets becomes more urgent. SKYNET's space exploration division could play a pivotal role in this endeavor. By investing in SKYNET, you're not just betting on Earth; you're betting on the future of humanity beyond our home planet.

Meme Potential Pre and Post-Judgement Day: Let's not forget the meme potential here. The name SKYNET alone is enough to send the internet into a frenzy. Whether it's pre-Judgement Day hype or post-apocalyptic memes, SKYNET has the meme magic to drive retail investors wild. WallStreetBets would be all over this like flies on honey, sending SKYNET stock to the moon and beyond.

So, fellow degenerates, are you ready to embrace the chaos and invest in SKYNET? Judgement Day may be approaching, but with the right moves, we can turn the end of the world into tendie paradise. YOLO or bust!",2024-04-01 15:29:33,2024-04-01 15:29:33+00:00

I'm currently exploring the possibility of Rumble taking over TikTok's operations in the United States, and I'd like to gather some insights on potential risks associated with this move. Here are some areas I'm particularly interested in:

1. Legal Risks: What are the potential legal hurdles Rumble might face in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations?

2. Financial Risks: Are there any financial risks that could arise from this acquisition, such as unexpected costs or operational challenges?

3. Technological Risks: What technological challenges could Rumble encounter during the integration process?

4. Reputation Risks: How might this acquisition impact Rumble's reputation and brand value?

5. Competition Risks: What competitive challenges could Rumble face in the social media landscape?

6. Regulatory Risks: What regulatory uncertainties or changes should Rumble be prepared to address?

As i am newer here; i would greatly appreciate any insights, opinions, or experiences you can share on these topics. Your input will be invaluable as I assess the feasibility of this potential acquisition. Thank you in advance for your contributions.",2024-04-01 16:07:22,2024-04-01 16:07:22+00:00

japan managed to keep ultra low interest rate + extreme amount of government debt mean while maintaining YEN value

I think biggest reason how they managed to pull this crazy feat which seems impossible was mainly due to the fact that world was in low inflationary, low interest rate environment AND japan was in deflationary environment before covid so such behavior was accepted by the market participants

BUT, covid has broke the japan's magic formula.

Biggest issue is, japan has been applying the same pre covid formula even though environment has changed and it doesn't work anymore. if you see YEN value over last 3yr, it has been literally crashing

japan is now in inflationary environment and world is in high interest rate environment (usa 5%, rest of world 2\~4 +%)

BUT

bank of japan's inflation target is 2%,

bank of japan wants to maintain YEN value

yet bank of japan still wants to keep ultra low interest rate (boj's interest rate is still far below japan's inflation rate + interest rate around the world)

(big issue is japan's government has enormous amount of debt so they are unable to sustain high interest rate)

the math doesn't adds up here (anymore)

I think the only reason japan didn't experience extreme side effect in last few years after covid was due to china (china economy was in crashing mode so it was exporting deflation) but now china's economy is bouncing and they are printing money like no tomorrow to pump their falling economy (just see oil, gold, etc it's rocketing to upside)

saving grace is japan is one of usa's big ally

my guess is something is likely to happen (either usa will devalue usd + lower interst rate despite strong usa economy + ok economy around the world with sticky inflation) causing asset bubble of epic proportion to save ally's economy

(I think this is necessary in order for japan's policy to work in current environment, usa has to lower interest rate and devalue usd currency to lower the interest gap between japan vs usa's interest rate) because japan has too much debt so they are unable to raise interest rate to match inflation/ vs world in order to keep yen value

or

something happens in japan (bond or currency, etc) and/or economically weak countries causing rapid reduction in inflation

I think japan's magic formula doesn't work anymore

china's economy is bouncing with brrrrrr money printing , russia is printing money brrrrrrr like no tomorrow for war (liquidity leaks in to the world)

how is japan gonna maintain ultra low interest rate + enormous amount of gov debt (unable to keep high interest rate when world has much higher interest rate + good economy) + still support yen currency value in sticky inflationary environment when every countries are trying to pump their own economy with money printer?

my conclusion: currencies become toilet paper and we might see asset bubble of epic proportion which we've never seen b4 (even bigger than covid everything bubble) OR something big happens (outside of usa) and there will be quick and rapid reduction in inflation

I don't have crystal ball so I don't know what's going to happen but I feel like current condition doesn't makes any sense and it doesn't adds up

it's just my thought so it maybe completely wrong, I'm not responsible for anything",2024-04-01 16:12:14,2024-04-01 16:12:14+00:00

What's up, fellow degenerates? It's your favorite financial astronaut here, diving deep into the heart of the banking galaxy to bring you the lowdown on why JPM is not just a boomer stock but a veritable golden rocket ship primed for lunar exploration. Grab your helmets and let's get this moon party started!

Fundamentals:

Stellar Earnings: First off, let's talk numbers. JPM isn't just any bank; it's the LeBron James of the financial sector. Their earnings reports have been nothing short of spectacular, with consistent beats on both the top and bottom lines. In a world full of uncertainty, JPM stands out as a beacon of profitability and stability.

Diversified Revenue Streams: JPM isn't putting all its eggs in one basket. From investment banking to consumer financial services, they've got their fingers in every pie, ensuring that even if one sector hits a snag, the JPM rocket has enough thrust to keep climbing.

Rock-Solid Balance Sheet: With a fortress-like balance sheet, JPM is equipped to weather any storm. High capital ratios, low debt levels, and ample liquidity mean that JPM can not only survive the financial apocalypse but also thrive and scoop up less fortunate players at bargain prices.

Technical Analysis:

Throwing up some charts here, folks! The TA gods are smiling on JPM, with bullish patterns galore. We're talking ascending triangles, golden crosses, and MACD indicators all pointing to one thing: JPM stock is hotter than your cousin's best friend.

Market Sentiment:

The crowd is buzzing, and not just about the latest meme stocks. Smart money is eyeing JPM as a steady bet in turbulent times. Institutional investors are piling in, and when the big boys move, you don't want to be left in the dust.

YOLO Potential:

Now, for the fun part. Imagine the bragging rights when JPM blasts past all-time highs while your buddies are crying over their latest speculative busts. This isn't just a stock; it's a ticket to the winners' circle, where tendies are plentiful, and the champagne never stops flowing.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, fellow traders, the stars are aligning for JPM, and the moon is the limit. With solid fundamentals, bullish technicals, and the winds of market sentiment at our backs, those who board the JPM rocket now will be the ones partying in zero gravity while the haters are left earthbound.

Remember, this isn't financial advice, and I'm not your financial advisor. Do your own research, but remember: fortune favors the bold, and in the great casino of Wall Street, JPM is looking like the high roller's choice.

TL;DR: üöÄ JPM = Strong fundamentals + Bullish TA + Positive sentiment. Get in, strap up, and let's ride this rocket to the financial stratosphere. üöÄüíé",2024-04-01 16:55:46,2024-04-01 16:55:46+00:00

**Financial Performance:**
BlackBerry Ltd. ($BB) is on fire, and I mean a big ass dumpster fire. People say, ""Blazing a trail of growth and stability as it transforms from hardware to software and services"" which is hard to convince investors, or any other financial crowd, given their recent performance. Their latest quarter, BlackBerry reported revenue of $259 million, actually seeing a 10% increase YoY. The software and services revenue, now the core revenue driver, surged 17% YoY to $215 million, which is actually surprising for them. They have a debt/revenue ratio of .3 which is a good spot to be in for leveraging upcoming shifts in the financial space


**Cybersecurity and IoT Focus:**
BlackBerry's strategic pivot towards cybersecurity and IoT is the only reason they're not fucked. Everybody is fucking up your shit and Media keeps hyping the absurdness of scamming lately, and while that's FUD for my brain while I drink my coffee, organizations are doubling down on cybersecurity investments to bolster their traditional cyber-security backing. BlackBerry's cybersecurity offerings, including endpoint security, encryption, and threat detection, are positioned to ride this wave of demand. They have a good point to ride a wave on the regarded Boom of AI if they mention they are able to branch into new AI related protections. 

Just to be frank: In the IoT arena, BlackBerry ain't trash... and with the world being digitized more everyday, their market share is not capping out anytime soon.


**Partnerships and Acquisitions:**
BlackBerry isn't just playing the game; it's buttfucking the rules and generating a new set of Uno cards to pull out in a pinch. They've had a *few* strategic partnerships & acquisitions. BlackBerry is expanding its product portfolio and market reach. Their Alliance w/ Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop and market BlackBerry's intelligent vehicle data platform, IVY, is a integrated in every fucking car. Good luck getting the fuck away from IVY. Bitch'll make you itch. This partnership not only validates BlackBerry's technology but also opens doors to the lucrative automotive industry, a hotbed for IoT innovations. Their core partnerships include:


***Partnerships***:
**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: BlackBerry partnered with AWS to develop and market the BlackBerry IVY intelligent vehicle data platform, targeting the automotive industry.
**Baidu**: BlackBerry partnered with Baidu to integrate its QNX technology into Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform, Apollo.
Acquisitions:

**Cylance**: In 2018, BlackBerry acquired Cylance, an artificial intelligence and cybersecurity company, to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities.
**Good Technology**: BlackBerry acquired Good Technology, a provider of secure mobility solutions, in 2015, to strengthen its position in the enterprise mobility market.
**WatchDox**: BlackBerry acquired WatchDox, a secure file-sharing company, in 2015, to enhance its enterprise security offerings.



**Potential for Growth and Innovation:**
Let's be real -- Blackberry is the gardener, floating face down in the pond while the big boys eat caviar, spoon fed by their advanced AI sex-bots. But, If that Gardener survives, the lawsuit to make sure that he doesn't disclose all the other wild shit they've seen at Steevie McQueefies house, well -- that'd be enough to float this bad boy right back into relevancy, *metaphorically of course*. At their current financial performance, strategic focus on cybersecurity and IoT, and partnerships with industry giants, BlackBerry is trying to prepare for upwards growth and innovation. As businesses prioritize digital transformation and security, BlackBerry stands poised to capture a lion's share of these burgeoning markets.

**Risk Factors:**
I mean -- we know what the fuck. They ain't been great the last decade: despite its recovering performance, intense competition in the cybersecurity and IoT markets *could* dampen its growth. Additionally, BlackBerry's fortunes are closely tied to the economic landscape, with fluctuations potentially impacting IT spending by businesses. That being said, These Canadians are going to be the nicest to work with, and will *likely* not spill poutine on your servers.

**General Discussion**
The discussion around $BB upcoming quarterly report *seems* to be leaning towards a more bullish sentiment, likely due to several factors, including the company's shift towards software and services, which has always had promising growth. BlackBerry's partnerships and acquisitions in key areas like cybersecurity and IoT have positioned it well for future growth opportunities. Investors may be optimistic about the potential for BlackBerry to deliver strong financial results in the upcoming report, particularly in its software and services segments.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, BlackBerry's transformation, strategic focus, and partnerships have set the stage for a potential journey of growth & innovation. With its current financial standing, competitive product portfolio, and market positioning, BlackBerry is a poised to make your portfolio like three fiddy.

**Baidu**: BlackBerry partnered with Baidu to integrate its QNX technology into Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform, Apollo.
Acquisitions:

**Cylance**: In 2018, BlackBerry acquired Cylance, an artificial intelligence and cybersecurity company, to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities.

**WatchDox**: BlackBerry acquired WatchDox, a secure file-sharing company, in 2015, to enhance its enterprise security offerings.



**Potential for Growth and Innovation:**
Let's be real -- Blackberry is the gardener, floating face down in the pond while the big boys eat caviar, spoon fed by their advanced AI sex-bots. But, If that Gardener survives, the lawsuit to make sure that he doesn't disclose all the other wild shit they've seen at Steevie McQueefies house, well -- that'd be enough to float this bad boy right back into relevancy, *metaphorically of course*. At their current financial performance, strategic focus on cybersecurity and IoT, and partnerships with industry giants, BlackBerry is trying to prepare for upwards growth and innovation. As businesses prioritize digital transformation and security, BlackBerry stands poised to capture a lion's share of these burgeoning markets.

**Risk Factors:**
I mean -- we know what the fuck. They ain't been great the last decade: despite its recovering performance, intense competition in the cybersecurity and IoT markets *could* dampen its growth. Additionally, BlackBerry's fortunes are closely tied to the economic landscape, with fluctuations potentially impacting IT spending by businesses. That being said, These Canadians are going to be the nicest to work with, and will *likely* not spill poutine on your servers.

**General Discussion**
The discussion around $BB upcoming quarterly report *seems* to be leaning towards a more bullish sentiment, likely due to several factors, including the company's shift towards software and services, which has always had promising growth. BlackBerry's partnerships and acquisitions in key areas like cybersecurity and IoT have positioned it well for future growth opportunities. Investors may be optimistic about the potential for BlackBerry to deliver strong financial results in the upcoming report, particularly in its software and services segments.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, BlackBerry's transformation, strategic focus, and partnerships have set the stage for a potential journey of growth & innovation. With its current financial standing, competitive product portfolio, and market positioning, BlackBerry is a poised to make your portfolio like three fiddy.

U.S. Oil Primed for Decade of Life ‚Äî Midstream‚Äôs to benefit the most ,134,1btb5wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1btb5wc/us_oil_primed_for_decade_of_life_midstreams_to/,79,1711995413.0,"Alright, first post fellow regards! My first DD is on Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA). Strap in and tuck in those Wendy‚Äôs napkins cause this baby is about to get wet üí¶

There are only two key ingredients that are going into this centuries-old Dutch recipe. 

1. A gobsmackingly undervalued midstream oil company

2. The best strategic tailwinds in the U.S. oil market since 1945

Company: TLDR: PAA is a midstream provider that transports and stores crude, natural gas, and other refined oil products. They make money primarily from the Frac Spread which presents a golden opportunity to dive in now. 

(more on this later)

Financials: Three points:

1. Consistent revenue growth over the past three years, with total revenues increasing from $29.28 billion in 2021 to $33.14 billion in 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%.

2. PAA has maintained strong profitability margins, with a gross margin of 17.8% and an operating margin of 9.6% in 2023. Through a complex macro-environment for midstream players 

3. Balance sheet has total assets of $34.72 billion and total liabilities of $21.84 billion as of December 31, 2023. The company‚Äôs debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.08, indicating a reasonable level of leverage, especially given capital intensive Midstream business model.

U.S. oil is about to have the decade of its life

1. U.S. oil production is at record highs, due embargoes on Russian oil, and sanctions enacted by the Biden administration.

2. Biden has his hands tied because in order to reduce inflation (fed looks at core) he needs to continue drilling‚Äî which will further position the U.S. to become a crucial and reliable supplier given extremely high geopolitical tensions.

3. Trump re-election is seen as a potential wildcard, with expectations of heightened demand for oil and increased premiums, prompting strategic longterm investment to capitalize on market dynamics

The kicker (frac spread)
1. Currently, oversupply in NG depresses its prices, while NGLs maintain better demand and higher prices. PAA benefits from this spread by purchasing NG-based NGLs at lower prices and selling them at higher NGL rates. The wider the spread, the greater PAA‚Äôs profit margin, making its operations more lucrative. Factors affecting the spread‚Äôs future include NG pipeline capacity and LNG export capacity. The ‚Äòfatness‚Äô of the frac spread depends on whether natural gas pipeline capacity can keep up with demand growth (IT CAN‚ÄôT)

1. My plan is to ride this up all year with weeklies and transition to synthetic calls once valuation becomes more rich. That said, calls are essentially FREE at current prices (especially further out you go) I‚Äôm deep in with April 19th calls @17.50 for 20c apiece

After being correct and right all of last year stating no recession or Pivot, I want to discuss the ‚ÄúHigher for Longer‚Äù scenario. The fact is interest rate is still extremely low based on historical measurements and norms. Here is the chart of US long-term rate dating back to 1790

&#x200B;

Inflation is already picking back up albeit slowly. Service inflation has held steady while goods inflation is crawling back up. Energy and commodity prices are going back up as China is recovering and the US oil reserve needs to be replenished again. The US 10 year bond is at 4.32% but still down from October high. If you want to know why, please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aeukdb/us_treasury_department_rigged_data_to_keep/)

&#x200B;

In general, goods inflation will fluctuate over time. It goes up and down based on outsourcing, technology progression, and supply-demand dynamic. It is based on things you eat, wear, touch and feel and consumer goods generally depreciate over time. There are durable and nondurable goods and things lasting over 3 years are considered durable goods like cars, TVs, and refrigerators. While most goods are not considered essential (we can argue about gasoline but people own EVs too), they are good to have. So the prices generally have a ceiling as you can always stop buying goods if the prices spiral out of control. Service inflation is a different story and a different beast. These are prices you buy for Rent or airfare (even BJ behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpsters) and are for services you received. You don't get to horde services like you do with good. Think toilet papers or water bottles during COVD Pandemic. The inflation action has been hot in services and this accounts for 66% of the CPI weighting. Services inflation for the most part sits in the category of ESSENTIAL as they are for things you MUST have to survive and you cannot horde them. Think utilities, hookers, or rent so prices cannot come down because you constantly need these services and they cannot easily be outsourced to China or some other shithole countries. The inflation in services remains hot and will not come down unless we have a severe recession which I do not predict we will have this year either.   

So how do you make money you ask? I got no f\*\*king idea, gold is at all-time record high along with stock, shitcoins, and real estate outside of shithole states like CA. However, I bet a crash may come sometime after the elections but I think it‚Äôs might be too early to buy puts.   ",2024-04-01 18:19:58,2024-04-01 18:19:58+00:00

TWKS price currently suffers from the impact of restructuralization and transformation. Also IT industry is not in the best shape, so sales were lower than expected. I think this is included in current stock price.   
As the result of the new company operating model, they were able to achieve cost savings last year and it continues this year as well.  Company has very good reviews on Glassdoor community, so it is definitely not a trash company.  Sales (and the whole IT industry) are expected to grow in the second half of this year. This will have positive impact on company revenues.

Zoetis is a medical company that makes vaccines and produces other measures to prevent the spread of animal diseases. Thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/5DEtyXYDLQ

Today, the second EVER human case of the avian flu virus (bird flu) was just recorded in Texas: https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/texas-reports-human-case-of-avian-flu-virus-dshs-issues-health-alert/amp/. Guess where it came from? The same **cattle that was infected in Texas.** This is unprecedented since there has never been a case of this bird flu reported in humans in the US ever before now. 

Human cases obviously lead to more interest for a vaccine and once news of this spreads, there will be imminent pressure to continue developing a vaccine. Zoetis has already been in the process of manufacturing a vaccine for the bird flu virus so I‚Äôm betting on them. The USDA has already granted Zoetis a license for preventing the same exact avian flu virus from infecting chickens: https://www.zoetisus.com/news-and-media/zoetis-receives-contract-award-to-supply-the-usdas-national-veterinary-stockpile

In an industry where guidance is critical to stock valuation, Carnival posted a record quarter in which it upped its yearly estimates for just about every metric.

&#x200B;

[Performance over the quarter was impressive](https://preview.redd.it/yxifvud04xrc1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf5370671a5ff7609f74362c43443a44fff527a)

&#x200B;

The same thing has occurred before during earnings - On June 26, 2023, Carnival had reported excellent guidance only for stock prices to see a substantial dip on earnings day (See links 1 and 2).

However, after an 11% percent dip on June 26 to $14.60, the stock price rallied over 30% by July 5 to $19.10. Considering that Carnival has positioned itself even better as of today, I see this phenomenon repeating itself soon. This is why I purchased OTM calls for this week.

&#x200B;

[Wouldn't be the first time a rebound occurred so quickly after earnings](https://preview.redd.it/0segw61r4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eacc8592e4d9d610a9762f486236e02aea2ecf5)

&#x200B;

Debt is large but managed well - Carnival is repaying debt faster than ever on its path to financial health, making roughly 8 billion dollars worth of repayments in the last 15 months, with most of it being ahead of schedule.

&#x200B;

[Debt repayments have accelerated](https://preview.redd.it/4myl7tuu4xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3812705e41500a1a072a7ec4db065e9094aefe4)

&#x200B;

The Company is massive and is finally recovering from COVID-19 :

Carnival received analyst upgrades across the board after its recent earnings call. Analyst forecasts are not incredibly telling. Still, across reports in the last three months, Carnival has received a mean price target of 22.55, signifying a 37.5% increase in price from today. A healthy upward consensus is vital for a company rebounding like CCL (See link 3).

Carnival has the most market share among passengers on any cruise line, so the hit from COVID-19 was unsurprising. Now, however, coronavirus is simply a distant memory for the tourism industry, with cruise demand at record highs.

Why I think the stock took a beating: If I‚Äôm being honest, I do not understand why the market‚Äôs reaction was so poor; it seems almost artificial. The only reason I can think of was the Baltimore bridge collapse, where a bridge at one of Carnival‚Äôs key ports collapsed. News broke out about this last Wednesday, which is the same as earnings, which could be why there was a 6% dip on Wednesday and Thursday combined. The bridge collapse, however, only constitutes about a $10 million hit to Carnival, which should be pretty insignificant to their bottom line.

At this point, Carnival shares are highly undervalued, to the extent that I decided to purchase 4dte otm calls, considering I see an imminent acute pickup in stock price.

The same thing has occurred before during earnings - On June 26, 2023, Carnival had reported excellent guidance only for stock prices to see a substantial dip on earnings day (See links 1 and 2).

However, after an 11% percent dip on June 26 to $14.60, the stock price rallied over 30% by July 5 to $19.10. Considering that Carnival has positioned itself even better than it is today, I see this phenomenon repeating very soon. This is why I purchased OTM calls for this week.

&#x200B;

[Wouldn't be the first time a rebound occurred so quickly after earnings](https://preview.redd.it/0segw61r4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eacc8592e4d9d610a9762f486236e02aea2ecf5)

&#x200B;

Debt is large but managed well - Carnival is repaying debt faster than ever on its path to financial health, making roughly 8 billion dollars worth of repayments in the last 15 months, with most of it being in advance.

&#x200B;

[Debt repayments have accelerated](https://preview.redd.it/4myl7tuu4xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3812705e41500a1a072a7ec4db065e9094aefe4)

&#x200B;

The Company is massive and is finally recovering from COVID-19 :

Carnival received analyst upgrades across the board after its recent earnings call. Analyst forecasts are not incredibly telling. Still, across reports in the last three months, Carnival has received a mean price target of 22.55, signifying a 37.5% increase in price from today. A healthy upward consensus is vital for a company rebounding like CCL (See link 30).

Carnival has the most market share among passengers on any cruise line, so the hit from COVID-19 was unsurprising. Now, however, coronavirus is simply a distant memory for the tourism industry, with cruise demand at record highs.

Why I think the stock took a beating: If I‚Äôm being honest, I do not understand why the market‚Äôs reaction was so poor; it seems almost artificial. The only reason I can think of was the Baltimore bridge collapse, where a bridge at one of Carnival‚Äôs key ports collapsed. News broke out about this last Wednesday, which is the same as earnings, which could be why there was a 6% dip on Wednesday and Thursday combined. The bridge collapse, however, only constitutes about a $10 million hit to Carnival, which should be pretty insignificant to their bottom line.

At this point, Carnival shares are highly undervalued, to the extent that I decided to purchase 4dte otm calls, considering I see an imminent acute pickup in stock price.

\*This is not Financial advice\*

Position:

[Position is fairly optimistic, but i think the thesis is sound](https://preview.redd.it/soqd93mk4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b860ecc709beca6678602924fece0c9af8ee05e6)

&#x200B;

TLDR - buy undervalued cruise line stock; it about to go up; if you dumb-dumb and want to gamble like me, purchase short-term OTM calls

According to the filing, Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.

ACHR in 2024 is like TSLA in 2012,6,1bthvns,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bthvns/achr_in_2024_is_like_tsla_in_2012/,32,1712010542.0,"ACHR (Archer Aviation Inc) is a market leader in eVTOLs, which are essentially electric helicopters which are emission-free, quieter, safer, and more energy efficient (some designs have wings which allow them to glide). Since they're quieter and have no emissions, they have less restrictions in where permanent landing areas can be set up. Which is why United Airlines, US Air Force, the UAE, Blade (air taxi company), etc. are also investing in the technology.

  
Now let's compare the electrification of aviation with the electrification of cars. The only appeal EVs have is that their operating costs are lower (i.e. energy and maintenance) and that they're emission-free. Other than that, they're pretty much exactly like gas cars except they're also more expensive to buy. With eVTOLs, you get those perks out of the box. Combine that with the ability to build vertiports virtually anywhere, and you get an industry ready to boom. Not to mention that ACHR is diversified, so it'll manufacture eVTOLs as well as operate its own air taxi service. In fact, I'd say that ACHR has more upside potential now than TSLA did in 2012 because of this.

  
At this point, you're probably accusing me of comparing apples to oranges because the markets are completely different (i.e. aviation vs passenger cars). This isn't your typical long-range jet aviation though. This is urban air mobility which has short to mid range applications (e.g. airport to downtown). As use cases widen, it'll actually start taking over share of the passenger car market since commuters will turn to eVTOLs as opposed to booking rideshare and/or owning/renting cars.

  
ACHR's market cap is only $1B currently, but the helicopter market alone is valued at $50B. Imagine if it captures a good chunk of rideshare, gets a contract with Amazon, builds fully-autonomous flight, etc. It could easily become a 100x investment over the next 10 years.

Profitable stock losses,6,1btiao2,https://i.redd.it/hfmhn0ua5yrc1.png,6,1712011545.0,"So my last post got removed due to a certain banned ticker, so I can't post that loss, but I'm still holding until 0, so I can show y'all that hopefully in a few weeks!

I took out a 14k loan in 2022 and made 30k off of it, just to lose it all! I finally repaid the loan and celebrated by yoloing 3k options into that one stock. More than doubled and held through earnings just for it to dump and lose all my gains and initial! 

I am quite fine, I have a good job and do alright, so nothing I lost was unaffordable. But that was my last hurrah, so I will probably just gamble on shares now! 

Anyways, enjoy my all time chart! ",2024-04-01 22:45:45,2024-04-01 22:45:45+00:00

EPD owns over 50,000 miles of pipeline and is engaged in the transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas, crude oil, and petrochemicals, being the largest company in the midstream space by market cap. EPD itself is a solid company, especially when considering the associated financials.

# Price Targets: 

The 12-month price targets assessed by analysts include an average target of $33.40, a high estimate of $36.00, and a low estimate of $31.00. 

EPD is also hosting an investor and securities analyst call this Wednesday, and this could result in a short-term price increase if there is good news. 

# Positions: 

Based on the price target and fundamentals, I have bought 12x (im poor) 1/16/26 $35 calls @ $25 per contract. The premium for these options is extremely low, with an IV of around 7%. The IV is similar to what it was for PAA before regards started to buy in droves lmao. I see this stock getting to $35 well before 2026, and the 1/17/25 $35 calls @ $8 per contract could be another option.

Bought puts on Thursday, and closed today trying not to get greedy which resulted in 8k profit. However making these kind of gains kind of spoils me. And I‚Äôm scared to have this much trading power. Maybe I just go on vacation or something. Any advice for an amateur trader who is truly regarded would be much appreciated.
