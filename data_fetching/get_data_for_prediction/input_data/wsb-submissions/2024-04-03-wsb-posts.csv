Hey guys some of y'all might remember me from yesterday's post from ""NVDA $850 Tomorrow"", fine it didn't but managed to profit a solid $900 USD from it. As y'all can see yesterday's performance for NVDA and the market as a whole is finished - it did rebound back up to 897 before closing, but as what u can see from the overnight it already drop 1.3% (which is wild), if pre-market drops another 0.5% today will likely close off at $875 - just those regards think NVIDIA is cheap so they'll buy it up but it definitely a bearish week ahead.

But from yesterday Share price did not have a massive sell-off at the beginning of the market opening hence, what i'll be doing is to buy calls at the market open which limit order would be a about $120 lower than the trading price for it to fill in and then just hold on till 1145.",2024-04-03 02:05:20,2024-04-03 02:05:20+00:00

TSMC Earthquake DD,65,1bujcwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bujcwl/tsmc_earthquake_dd/,60,1712117361.0,"**Like most of you guys I was initially worried about the earthquake and. TSMC.**

**HOWEVER.... I remembered that Taiwan is on the ""Ring of Fire""**

**AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK.**

**\*\*QUESTIONS TO ASK\*\***

**1) Why would TSMC not consider ""Ring of Fire"" in their own contingency/safety plans?**

**2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk?**

**Article 1:** [**TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes**](https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/governance/caseStudy/1/index.html)

**Article 2:** [**Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage**](https://www.asiafinancial.com/shock-absorbers-help-taiwan-chip-plants-avoid-quake-damage)

**Key Points from Article 1:**

* Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks.
* TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty.

|2000|

The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities.

|2008|

The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%.

|2012|

Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage.

|2013

Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool.

|2015|

Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. 

|2016|

Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling.

**The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability.**

**Article 2:**

# Shock Absorbing Plant Designs

‚ÄúIn terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,‚Äù the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage.

‚ÄúIn the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúIn terms of memory, [**Nanya Technology**](https://www.nanya.com/en/) has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.‚Äù

Meanwhile, [**Micron**](https://www.micron.com/) had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment ‚Äúand has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,‚Äù the TrendForce report said.

In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues.

‚ÄúPanel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,‚Äù it said. [**Innolux**](https://www.innolux.com/en/product-and-tech/tech/foplp.html), based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September.

‚ÄúThus, the actual impact of the recent earthquakes should be limited in severity,‚Äù it concluded. ‚ÄúMachinery had been slowed or shut down for maintenance during the earthquake and operations have, subsequently, been resumed.‚Äù

Factory campuses had cancelled weekend overtime and returned to a normal shift schedule with only the sintering process in continuous operation. But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said.

# Taiwan‚Äôs Importance

It is worth noting that Taiwan‚Äôs importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island‚Äôs biggest company, has a [**more than half of the global foundry market**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf), while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market.

One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs visit to the island last month was allegedly to [**convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States**](https://theconversation.com/taiwan-dominates-the-worlds-supply-of-computer-chips-no-wonder-the-us-is-worried-188242).

It‚Äôs big money ‚Äì the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector‚Äôs importance has risen dramatically.

People in Taiwan are probably saying a quiet prayer of thanks that the weekend‚Äôs quakes were not a lot worse

3. NVIDIA has been the ticker to characterize the bull market

In 2023 Terawulf was finally able to turn on some of the computer and make some money. They‚Äôre continuing throughout 2024 and 2025 to build this computer and turn more of it on making more and more money.

Unlike similar companies, Terawulf is very transparent and is constantly releasing their financial information. So before ‚Äúofficial‚Äù quarterly earnings come out, anyone paying attention can have a good idea of if the earnings are going to be good.  
 

A lot of people don‚Äôt understand how to read Terawulf‚Äôs financial information since it is somewhat filled with computer jargon. However, if you can understand what Terawulf is saying you can have a leg up everyone waiting to see the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù earnings report which is very easy to understand.

Looking at Terawulf‚Äôs information, I can easily predict that the official Terawulf 2024 Q1 report that comes out in mid May 2024, will be very good. It will show they‚Äôre making a lot more money than ever before while eliminating their debt at a rapid pace.

Based off Terawulf‚Äôs total company value of about 700 million, paired with the fact that they are currently making over $500,000 a day in profit after expenses, leads me to believe they are very undervalued at their current price of $2.33  
 

As they continue into 2024 and 2025 they are growing their computer size and power.  
 

The company has talked about using the computers in the future to potentially run AI, but right now Bitcoin works by using this Terawulf computer, and in exchange Bitcoin gives Terawulf money.  
   
 **That‚Äôs the basics in very simple terms. Here‚Äôs another slightly more complex but still very simple breakdown.**  
 

Terawulf has built two facilities in New York and Pennsylvania that are basically two huge state of the art computers. They‚Äôve built these computer facilities to create an enormous amount of computing power. They then use this computing power to make money.

Terawulf ‚Äúmines Bitcoin‚Äù or using their computing power, Terawulf helps run the Bitcoin network. Similar to how Google could hire Terawulf‚Äôs computing power, to help run their email system GMAIL.  
 

Terawulf, gets paid in Bitcoin daily, and immediately sells it for a hefty profit. The Terawulf CEO has invested millions of his own money into Terawulf and stated that the company is not in the business of speculating on the price of Bitcoin. They simply ‚ÄúMine‚Äù Bitcoin everyday for a profit in American Dollars, not Bitcoin.

The mining of Bitcoin relies heavily on the cost of energy to run your computer. Terawulf‚Äôs CEO Paul Prager specializes in energy, and has been able to lock in very cheap energy prices for several years, which is why Terawulf is positioned to become the next leader in Bitcoin mining.  
 

**TERAWULF‚ÄôS BACKSTORY**

TERAWULF was formed in 2021, and their plan was to lock in long term cheap North American power (5-20 year plans). Not just any power, but Zero Carbon energy. Not only is it better for the environment, but in a world where regulations are moving in that direction, it‚Äôs better to be ready for it. 

Once they locked in inexpensive green power, they bought land and started construction on buildings. Right now they have buildings in New York and Pennsylvania. Two states that have had discussions and laws even passed against companies mining bitcoin‚Ä¶ but mining bitcoin with ‚Äúbad‚Äù energy. Since Terawulf‚Äôs goal is 100% carbon free energy, they don‚Äôt have to worry.

Terawulf spent all of 2021 - 2022 getting their facilities ready. They started turning on the computers in 2023, but are still building and turning on new machines for 2024, and anticipate this continuing into 2025.

**STOCK PRICE**

Terawulf began this venture in 2021, during the last cryptocurrency bull run. Speculation was crazy in 2021 around anything crypto and Bitcoin related. Along with many other assets and mining companies, WULF‚Äôs price rocketed to a high of $44 per share in Nov 2021.

However soon after Bitcoin‚Äôs price went down and so did Terawulf‚Äôs stock price. WULF shares dropped as low as $0.53 in March 2023. 

Rightfully so, I mean Terawulf up until that point had just taking on hundreds of millions in debt to build their facilities. According to their earnings reports this company just lost money month after month, year after year. They were just an idea in 2021.  
 

Most people don‚Äôt know what Bitcoin Mining is, so when they see Terawulf, they see it‚Äôs a bitcoin mining company and don‚Äôt really know what the hell that means.

They‚Äôre investors not computer tech folks. So investors look at what they do know‚Ä¶ the earnings reports. Well‚Ä¶ the earnings reports are terrible. Average investors don‚Äôt know why or care, and just move on to the next potential investment.

However we now know the earnings reports were bad not because Terawulf was a failure, but because Terawulf is still in the building stages.

It‚Äôs as if Ferrari spent over two years building a race car. But every month people asked how fast the race car was, and Ferrari said it went 0 mph. So everyone continued to write off this race car as a failure, without knowing that it was going to take 3 years to build. 

We shouldn‚Äôt judge a race care on how fast it goes until it‚Äôs built, just like the market shouldn‚Äôt have judged Terawulf on how profitable it was before it was built.  
 

I think the stock market thinks Terawulf is a fully built race car that goes 0mph, when in reality it is a half built race car that when fully built, will be the fastest car in the race.

Earnings reports are a major factor in how investors judge a company. Most articles and reports online are based off Terawulf‚Äôs released earnings reports. Those earnings reports don‚Äôt go past 2023, and those reports were bad up until the end of 2023.

Currently, when you research Terawulf online, you‚Äôre likely to find a writeup that an algorithm wrote based off earnings reports before Oct 2023. The reports are filled with BAD numbers, and don‚Äôt explain that Terawulf was simply building their race car.  
 

Now normally everyone has to wait until the company releases its earnings report to know how everything going. Not with Terawulf though.  
 

Terawulf is not your average company, they are very transparent and have been releasing their numbers on their social media and their website. They are proud of what they accomplished and believe in a company that doesn‚Äôt hide behind walls, but instead informs investors of exactly what is going on.  
 

They don‚Äôt pay for fancy marketing, they just make a damn good product and wait for word to catch on.   
 

However, NOBODY is reading Terawulf‚Äôs reports‚Ä¶ their twitter posts get maybe 100 likes, and a few spam comments.  
 

So unless you‚Äôre one of the few like me listening, you are judging their company on the earnings reports from 2023.

However they just started turning on their machines in 2023, and have been expanding at a rapid rate throughout 2024.  
 

On Fidelity and Charles Schwab if you click on reports for Terawulf and look at earnings‚Ä¶ MISSED in big red letters pops up. 

For investors it‚Äôs basically saying LOSER LOSER LOSER, over and over and over.

My question is how did the person estimating earnings not get it right when the company is literally telling you the numbers to go off of?

I think it‚Äôs because people are trying to put Terawulf into an algorithm instead of seeing it as a unique new company that needs a proper investigation.

Now if you‚Äôre following Terawulf on social media and understand Bitcoin Mining you‚Äôd know that 2024 Q1 was a big winner for Terawulf. However, the a lot of people simply wait for the official earnings reports in mid May.  
 

Basically we are ahead of curve by over a month and a half.

I don‚Äôt know when exactly Wall Street is going to catch up on this, but right now WULF seems undervalued. The confusion around what exactly is Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, mixed with waiting for earnings reports has falsely labeled Terawulf a loser.   
 

I anticipate that between now and summer of 2024 the market will catch on.   
 

**P/E ratio**  
 We discussed the price of the stock versus the earnings of the company. This is called a P/E ratio for short. Terawulf‚Äôs P/E ratio right now is about 4/1 since the entire value of the company is four times more than their gross earnings for the year.

.5M a day after expenses x 365 days is about $180M which is about a fourth of companies total value of about 700 million.

In comparison to the software industry average of 56/1 which is what fidelity chose to compare it to Terawulf to.  
 

A 56/1 P/E for Terawulf would value the stock $28 a share instead of $2 a share.  
 

MARA Marathon Digital is a mining company that has a current P/E of 23/1.

WULF at $11 a share would be a 23/1 P/E.  
 

Now there are many other factors to consider and I think $10 a share is closer to a fair value at the moment.  
 

I also think the stock could go to $100 a share considering how crazy the market can get, especially around something with the word Bitcoin in it.

However I am not an expert with how to value a company like this, should it be 3 billion or 10 billion, I‚Äôm not sure. What the stock market values and what it doesn‚Äôt is a best guess.  
 

There‚Äôs so many things to consider, and nothing is guaranteed in this world. A comet could hit the Terawulf facility and blow it up tomorrow and drive the price to a few pennies.   
 

I‚Äôm not a finial advisor, I have no idea your finances nor can I guarantee my beliefs or that I am missing something. I‚Äôm simply stating what I find interesting about this company and sharing that info and my beliefs.   
 

Anyway, thanks for reading my overall theory. Below is some more details and info to consider.  
 

**DEEPER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE**  
 

**SHORTS**

Another reason why the price is so low, are the shorts have been opening up on this stock since 2022. I think it was a smart move at first, but now is the time to close those shorts as Terawulf continues powering up.

Here‚Äôs a in depth analysis on Terawulf‚Äôs shorts leading to a short squeeze.

[https://www.reddit.com/user/jamesroland17/comments/1bjhanr/my\_wulf\_short\_squeeze\_thesis/](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamesroland17/comments/1bjhanr/my_wulf_short_squeeze_thesis/)

**STOCK DILUTION**

One negative I noticed was how Terawulf has been diluting their stock. Kind of how when the FED prints more dollars and as a result the price of groceries goes up. It‚Äôs normal for a company to be issuing stock to pay bills and incentivize employees. About 40% of the company is owned by insiders, which means the people working for the company seem to believe in its success. They don‚Äôt seem to plan on heavy stock dilution for 2024 from what I‚Äôve heard them say, and while it‚Äôs something to consider, I don‚Äôt see it as a major red flag since the CEO actively addresses it. We‚Äôll wait and see how 2024 pans out stock dilution wise. 

Some believe that since insider ownership is so high, they can just majority vote to dilute all they want and make their money that way while hurting the shareholders. I don‚Äôt think this is the case since it‚Äôs actively addressed.  
 

**HIGH SG&A**  
 

Another concern is an unusually high SG&A for such a small company. I reached out to them and heard this back.  
 

**‚Äú**SG&A break-down of $27-$28MM guidance for 2024

Executive mgmt. team payroll + annual bonus: \~$8MM

All supporting staff (internal audit, legal, operations, etc.): \~$9MM

Public co costs (ie auditors, lawyers, investor relations, insurance):\~ $10MM

As a comparative note, all of our public peers have significantly higher SG&A expenses (i.e. CIFR and BITF are >$70MM annually) and do not provide forward guidance. Our level of transparency is unmatched.‚Äù

While it didn‚Äôt answer all my questions, the fact that there is so much insider ownership makes me believe that they truly are looking to make the stock price go up. At the end of the day I‚Äôm chasing to believe what the company is saying their goals are, seeing how profitable they actually makes me still bullish even with this high SG&A.

**WULF HISTORY**

Terawulf was started in 2021, they bought IKONICS CORPORATION in 2021. So if you look at the history of the stock ticker symbol WULF, you will notice it goes back to 1993.¬†

However, this price data doesn‚Äôt apply to the current company Terawulf, since as planned Terawulf sold Ikonics in 2022.  
 

This WULF stock history adds to the confusion and messes with any algorithms taking in numbers from the old company and projecting it onto the new company.  
 

Another reason why this company is flying under the radar‚Ä¶ for now.  
 

**DEBT**  
 

Terawulf took on Debt, they have been paying off their debt enormously the last few months. They could act like an ATM and just sell shares to pay off their 58 million debt as of February 2024, but instead they‚Äôre protecting shareholders in my opinion by paying off their debt quickly with their profits. They‚Äôre expanding at a healthy pace and are looking for the best deals in order to expand further. They‚Äôre not just expanding to expand if it doesn‚Äôt make sense profits wise. A lot of other Bitcoin miners are just diluting shares rapidly and in my opinion aren‚Äôt set up with cheap enough power to be that profitable in the future.

**TECH INFO**  
 

On the off chance someone reading this understand BTC mining, here are some basic tech specs. TeraWulf Inc. announces 7.9 EH/s of self-mining capacity, with plans to reach 10 EH/s by mid-2024. In March 2024, the company self-mined 379 bitcoins bringing the yearly total to 1,056 bitcoins at an average rate of 12.5 bitcoins per day. The power cost per bitcoin was $13,798, with an average operating hashrate of 7.6 EH/s. The average total cost including all expenses is $25,000 per Bitcoin with the average sell price of $67,394.

**BITCOIN PRICE**

Bitcoins price does effect WULF‚Äôs profit, but they have set themselves up to be profitable well into the foreseeable future, including after the April 2024 Bitcoin Halving. Explaining the Bitcoin halving would be a lot right now, but it‚Äôs basically an event happening in April 2024 that effects the profits of Bitcoin miners. There‚Äôs a lot of miners that aren‚Äôt in a good position to capitalize on this event. Terawulf is in my opinion set up to be one of the most profitable mining companies after the halving. Once again this is a very complex thing to understand, but I‚Äôve seen articles scaring Bitcoin Mining investors about the halving, and rightfully so. Just because Terawulf is set up for success doesn‚Äôt mean the Bitcoin Mining Market as a whole might not panic and temporarily drive down mining company prices. Another thing of many I‚Äôve considered and any investor should too. WULF released that the total cost with all expenses to mine a Bitcoin will be $37,000 so as long as BTC is above this price after the halving, Terawulf is profitable mining Bitcoin. 

In conclusion, Terawulf is positioned in 2024 to pay off all debt and set record breaking profits. Main things I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for‚Ä¶ share dilution, BTC under 40k, Shorts.  
 

**THANK YOU**  
 Once agin, I could be missing something here, Terawulf could be lying like Enron for all we know, I do not know everything nor can I predict the future.  
 

So if you do your own research please let me know if you find something I missed, I‚Äôll be very grateful.  
 

Thanks for reading!

Solventum- Potentially undervalued spin-off,9,1bupvm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bupvm8/solventum_potentially_undervalued_spinoff/,15,1712142580.0,"The following Due Diligence is pretty simple and straightforward. 

Solventum operates in the medical/nursing care industry and provides many commodities and hardware to dental clinics, hospitals and medical institutions/research facilities. Think about scalpels, gloves, respiratory equipment, bandages, teeth fillings and crowns, x-ray and other dental equipment, and also some medical electronic hardware/software and filtration and purification systems.

Currently( April 3rd, 2024), in their **specific** industry, they have the highest ROA( 9.78%), 5th highest ROE( 11.5%) and the highest ROIC(11.43%). Their debt to equity ratio is 0.01 and cash to debt ratio of 1.98, both of which are very good. In fact, even though they are spin-off, they basically have no liabilities and actually have a negative net debt (excess cash) of 96 million dollars, according to their December 2023 reports. 

Joel Greenblatt, a legendary investor who made a significant amount of his fortune thanks to spin-offs and wrote a book about his experiences, emphasizes the potential upside such newly founded companies can present to investors. Usually, when a spin-off is completed, Mr Market creates a bearish attitude towards the stock and sends it down. It can occur several days or weeks after the spin-offs' IPO and it creates a lucrative buying opportunity. 

Right now, I'm waiting for such an opportunity to manifest.

 \-10%, -15%, -20% are normal occurrences with spin-offs short time after an IPO. 

I see here a potential repeat of GE HealthCare, GE's spin off from last year, where the stock plummeted in the range of -10% days after the IPO and both GEHC and SOLV operate in the medical sector( albeit slightly different focuses). Now its true that GE itself outperformed its Spin off by a large margin, but I suspect it was both the fact that the company was improving its fundamentals, Chris Hohn's involvement with the company and also perhaps because of a heavy bullish pressure from buyers to be eligible to own its future spin-off, Vernova. 

I think we can all agree here that 3M is a dumpster fire and will continue to lose value for its shareholders, at least for the next 12 months.

Full disclosure, I own some KLG stock, spin-off to K, and I bought it around November-December after it dropped 40% in October last year **and** after 6 insiders purchased 2 million worth of stock. 

I missed out on a buying opportunity with WS, a spin-off to WOR, after it dropped -19% several days after its IPO( there was no real reason, just sucking my thumb honestly). 

It is true that not all spin-offs are created equal. However, those that come from well-established, old and mature enterprises, from traditional industries and sectors, perhaps current( and former) industry leaders, offer rare upside for *RELATIVELY* low risk.

That's about it, folks.

Good luck to you all, fellow regards!",2024-04-03 11:09:40,2024-04-03 11:09:40+00:00

Zscaler - buy buy buy,0,1buqoww,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1buqoww/zscaler_buy_buy_buy/,17,1712145315.0,"Cybersecurity stocks have been left behind in Q1.  In particular, both ZS and PAWN have seen healthy pullbacks but technical signals suggest they're coiling for breakouts. ZS in particular has a tendency to go vertical after consolidating sideways, which is exactly where it's been stuck recently. Technically, it's showing a falling pattern (so far no signs of a wedge), and has continued to stay above resistance, but failing to break out. While I can't perfectly time it given the lack of break out, all signs are pointing to ZS being primed for a breakout and once it does, I suspect it will hit 210 relatively soon and then 250 this summer.

&#x200B;

1. The initial decline in Zscaler (ZS) shares was a reaction to growth issues raised about a competitor, Palo Alto Networks (PANW). However, this seems more like a market hiccup rather than a fundamental issue with ZS.
2. Impressively, ZS surpassed both revenue and profit expectations in its latest quarterly report, but the stock experienced an unwarranted dip. This might indicate a great buying opportunity.
3. Truist met the management recently and maintained buy rating with a target of $260.
4. Despite a 10% rise in the overall market, ZS has seen a 30% drop year-to-date. This contrast highlights a potential undervaluation.
5. From a technical standpoint, the stock is at a sweet spot ‚Äì near the lower Bollinger Band with a clear falling wedge pattern, with high chances of reversal (having continued to fight selling at the bottom).
6. Solid cash position and investment in growth.  3 acquisitions YTD, most recently Avalor ($350m).
7. Unlike the last pullback when there was a lot of news of cutting costs, this time ZS is on a hiring spree (seems to be poaching senior talent from servicenow).
8. Ignore the P&L - company has been weighed down by its stock comps.  It has a healthy cash position.  The stock has been overly sensitive to Fed and their positioning on interest rates, which is a little unfair given they have more cash than they get credit for.

So, my recommendation is to buy now. ZS, at its current price of $188, seems poised for a significant upswing, potentially reaching $250 this summer before the results come out.  I also suspect upturn will come this week or next week as analysts start projecting in anticipation of the next quarter (May 29).",2024-04-03 11:55:15,2024-04-03 11:55:15+00:00

1. The initial decline in Zscaler (ZS) shares was a reaction to growth issues raised about a competitor, Palo Alto Networks (PANW). However, this seems more like a market hiccup rather than a fundamental issue with ZS.
2. Impressively, ZS surpassed both revenue and profit expectations in its latest quarterly report, but the stock experienced an unwarranted dip. This might indicate a great buying opportunity.
3. Truist met the management recently and maintained buy rating with a target of $260.
4. Despite a 10% rise in the overall market, ZS has seen a 30% drop year-to-date. This contrast highlights a potential undervaluation.
5. From a technical standpoint, the stock is at a sweet spot ‚Äì near the lower Bollinger Band with a clear falling wedge pattern, with high chances of reversal (having continued to fight selling at the bottom).

So, my recommendation is to buy now. ZS, at its current price of $188, seems poised for a significant upswing, potentially reaching $250 this summer before the results come out.

Obviously I'm special regarded but I think I may have found something here.

Let me through some buzz words here to spice it up - and yes they shed their light on all of these:

QUANTUM FIBER

CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES

DATA CENTER  
Also clients like Cloudflare, AMAZON, Microsoft are known to be using their services.

Anyway, LUMN used to be CenturyLink and they actually used to have lots of debt. However, they have been restructuring heavily, slashing debts and striking deals to stabilise their business.  
One of such moves was to get rid of their EMEA business selling it to COLT but striking a deal to be able to serve EMEA clients through COLT's infrastructure. There was even someone claiming that MSFT is about to buy them.  


Now here comes the best part:

They have been free-falling since COVID but are actually getting their stuff together. With their deal to restructure their debt and reducing their outstanding maturities for 25-26 form 2.1b to 600mil I believe they will be in a upswing.  
Fk it nobody cares about this right? But wait, there is more:

Their upcoming earnings is on 30th of April and I believe with all the news about reducing debt and cutting costs their outlook will be great. Also, call options are dirt cheap currently. You could also go the safe way - as I do and buy leaps which are also cheap on the 1.5 but I can't see them not recovering above minimum 1.6 after earnings.

Yeah their car and streaming bets flopped, but the Apple bears counting them out are missing one thing - Cupertino is going back to its roots: kicking ass in computers and chips.

Just look at what they did with M1. Apple's silicon plays are insane. You really think they won't leverage that into servers and AI in a massive way?

The narrative is AAPL has lost its mojo. That's exactly when they strike. I've been loading the dip under $175. 

Mark my words:

* $210 by WWDC in June when they flex the new compute/AI roadmap
* $300 within 12 months as the AI server ramp kicks into higher gear

Don't underestimate Apple when they get lean and refocus on the core markets they dominated for decades. A $3T comeback arc is brewing.

Consensus is they are defending, but I suspect they will make a play for the DC dollars.

"CHK-SWN merger to create largest US natural gas producer, Q2 2024 ‚Äì how to play",67,1buw294,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1buw294/chkswn_merger_to_create_largest_us_natural_gas/,29,1712159515.0,"I‚Äôve been following Chesapeake Energy since January, when they announced a $7.4 billion acquisition of rival SWN ‚Äì Southwestern Energy, but over the Easter weekend I finally had time to delve into the details. My original hunch has been confirmed so here‚Äôs my write up.

CHK restructured during Covid and over the past few years has been buying up its regional rivals ‚Äì Vine Energy in 2021, Chief Oil & Gas in 2022, and now SWN in 2024. Despite this it has over a billion dollars in cash and nearly 2 billion if you count short-term investments. As the macroeconomic environment stabilises we should now begin to see these investments being realised and, after thinking all week about how to play this, I have decided to ride SWN (the company which will be merging into CHK) upwards all the way to the merger and beyond, as this should maximise upside potential.

Key points:

* Merger on track for Q2 2024, this will make the new CHK-SWN combination the largest US natural gas producer, period.

* Expect SWN to continue its upwards trajectory as interest ramps up closer to the time and investors seek ways to play the US energy market this summer.

* $7.4 billion acquisition value provides a price floor significantly limiting any downside risk

* Natural gas becoming crucial to national security, demand is rising increasing existing profits and making new developments profitable

* SWN is sitting on 2.5 million undeveloped acres in Canada. Currently unable to be developed due to Canada‚Äôs ban on hydraulic fracturing, however should the winds change later this year SWN‚Äôs historic highs in the $40s (in 2014 before the fracking ban) give us an indication of how high it could rise. Note that this last point is a long shot but not essential ‚Äì it would only be the cherry on top of the icing.

Risks:

* The FTC will be following this merger due to antitrust concerns. However, in my view the Biden administration will not risk alienating key states such as Pennsylvania (where most of SWN‚Äôs activities are) and Texas (its headquarters) in an election year. Also, CHK's past acquisitions have all gone through, and, with no news since Jan and the Q2 date coming up, everything is on track as expected.


Positions:

* Half in SWN Jan 2025 $10 strike leaps, the other half in shares. Play shorter expirations if you are feeling riskier. This is not financial advice.",2024-04-03 15:51:55,2024-04-03 15:51:55+00:00

**Revenue**

Guidance was provided at a 1-3% increase YoY from FY23's revenue of $6.178B bringing estimated YoY bounds to \[$6.2398B,$6.3633B\]. $LEVI's Q1s typically store 26.6% of a fiscal year's revenues bringing Q1's revenue guidance expectations to \[$1.657B, $1.690B\] whereas the expected bounds of Q1's revenue are \[$1.543B,$1.549B\]

**Evaluation & Conclusion**

$LEVI shows a YoY decline in Net Income whilst Revenues remain constant with slight increase. While taking the difference of revenues and net income, it is provided there is a substantially increasing cost of goods sold. This can mean an entity is becoming less profitable overtime, or a market is swaying away from the trend of purchasing a firms goods/services in an industry/sector. As of writing this, $LEVI's price-per-share is $19.00 with a TTM basic EPS of 0.97. This provides a standing P/E ratio of 19.59, a fair P/E based on historical data. Assuming retention of the 19.59 P/E and following a 0.21 Q1 basic EPS, $LEVI's predicted pricing will fall to $16.26. This is a predicted 14.4% decrease. Other firms such as $NKE and $LULU fell between the ranges of \[6.9%,15.8%\] showing a 14.4% decrease is within the realm of possibilities.",2024-04-03 16:40:54,2024-04-03 16:40:54+00:00

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is the CEO/Executive Chairman of both the ALCC and Oklo. Yes, Altman is using his own SPAC to take take his own company public. ALCC is up nearly 10% in the last few days and is now trading around 15% above NAV.



Oklo's advanced fission reactors offer reliable, scalable, emission-free, and cost-efficient energy solutions, making them ideal for powering energy-intensive AI computing operations in data centers.

Sam Altman's involvement with Oklo could benefit the company in several ways to power AI data centers - 

Industry Credibility: Altman's reputation and track record in the tech industry, especially as CEO of OpenAI, lend credibility to Oklo's technology and its potential to power AI data centers effectively.

Network and Connections: Altman's extensive network and connections in the tech world could open doors for Oklo to form partnerships or collaborations with major players in the AI and data center industries. This could lead to increased adoption of Oklo's energy solutions.

Strategic Guidance: As a co-founder of AltC Acquisition Corp and chairman of Oklo, Altman likely provides strategic guidance and insights based on his experience in leading innovative tech companies. This could help Oklo navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the AI data center market.

Alignment with OpenAI's Mission: OpenAI's mission to advance artificial intelligence aligns with the goals of many AI data centers. Altman's involvement with Oklo could lead to synergies between the two entities, potentially resulting in collaborative projects or initiatives that leverage Oklo's energy solutions to power AI research and development.",2024-04-03 16:43:32,2024-04-03 16:43:32+00:00

I have not been able to find any news on what could be triggering this sell off. Tipranks and marketwatch both gave strong buy/buy ratings and haven't changed their ratings since. Hell, I'm pretty sure I saw TPR on a ""top S&P500 companies"" list this week on /wsb (can't find the post anymore)

Calls are super cheap for earnings in may. 5/17 50$ calls going for 0.85$ when they were trading for up to 2$ just this month and 2.5$ last month.

I don't see why this thing wouldn't recover to at least 48$ in the next week or two, given no apparent selloff trigger.

We all remember the hype when Canada legalized.  Everyone thought it was the ultimate infinite money glitch.

And for a while, based on the hype, it was.  Canada was the first major first world country to outright legalize (sorry Netherlands your half measures are no good for stonks), and the outlook was looking good for US legalization.  We had a boomer Republican president in the US at the time, but one who was decidedly less hostile to Marijuana than the typical boomer Republican.  Speaking of boomers‚Ä¶their parents who grew up watching reefer madness and blamed all crime on Mexican reefer addicts and always voted 98% no to any loosening of marijuana laws were finally starting to fucking die.  No one under 40 still thought it should be illegal and the national pulse had finally turned in favor of legalizing nationwide in the US.  Everyone saw it coming imminently.

But Canada is a nation of 38 million.  Barely a single major city in the US.  Not nearly enough to justify the size and scope of the weed market that emerged.  The stonks soared.  I remember ACB at 200 times it‚Äôs current price.

But it slowly dawned that no, in fact, America wasn‚Äôt going to reschedule, let alone legalize.  There wasn‚Äôt going to be a big enough market to support all the infrastructure the Canadian firms invested in.  The stocks cratered and a lot of degenerates lost a lot of money.

Then Biden, a democrat, gets elected‚Ä¶.the democrats being the party who overwhelmingly support legalization, it stood to reason that a liberalization of American marijuana law was imminent and again the stocks popped, though nowhere near the 2019 highs.

I lost like 75% before giving up and selling my shares, and good thing I did, because I‚Äôd have lost another 75% had I sat on it.

Now Germany just legalized and again the stocks are popping and a lot of us can‚Äôt see past these old painful memories.  I get it.

Just hear me out.

Now keep in mind right off the bat Germany is a much bigger nation and economy than Canada (>2X the population and 1.25x the GDP, roughly).  It alone can support a much larger market than Canada.  So the pop in weed stocks we‚Äôve seen now is already justified and yet they still have tremendous upside.

But my fellow regards, this is just the warmup round.

Joe Brandon is in trouble.  He‚Äôs behind in the polls, he‚Äôs seen as old, stuffy and senile.  His oldness, stuffiness and senility are perfectly encapsulated by his antiquated commitment to continuing marijuana prohibition.  It‚Äôs worth noting that he is the leader of a party that abandoned its commitment to marijuana prohibition decades ago and while he‚Äôs stubbornly been clinging to it more and more of the old fuddie duddie hardliners have died and almost no one in the country still supports continuing prohibition.  Certainly almost no democrats.  Also, RFK is running as an independent and he has confirmed he will make marijuana legalization a priority.  While RFK will be pulling support from trump too (think Covid hoaxery) I am convinced he‚Äôll be pulling harder from Brandon.

Brandon needs something big to revitalize his campaign, and he‚Äôs been dropping hints that marijuana very well could be that thing.  April is ‚Äúsecond chance month‚Äù and this year he went further than before in his commentary on the topic, suggesting rescheduling and/or hinting at legalization.  Kamala Harris has been pressuring the DEA to take action now.  Things are happening that are unlike anything from 2019 or 2021.  Traditionally 4/20 is associated with marijuana and the bettor in me senses something big may be coming this month, possibly on or around that day.

Yes, marijuana stocks are up somewhat on German legalization, but still down well over 90 to 95% or more from the 2019 highs.

I‚Äôm not saying YOLO on weed calls.  But picking up some shares right now is a relatively low risk (the stocks are already so so so far downbeaten with residual pessimism) move with tremendous potential upside.

********

Some more edits.

1) German legalization not being true commercial legalization.

True and a valid point.  The play here is not on German legalization.  The play is on an anticipation of a forthcoming change in US law.  Apart from being the worlds largest economy, the US has been the stick bearer enforcing marijuana prohibition around the world.  Many nations have wanted to legalize in the past but have been held back by the UN convention on psychtropic drugs from the 70s‚Ä¶the U.S. has been the standard bearer of enforcement of that convention.  Once the US legalizes, I think that this UN convention loses relevancy and the dominoes will start falling in short order and many more nations will legalize.  The smart money knows this and the bulk of the movement in the stock will all happen once the US announces meaningful change.  The play is to get ahead of that announcement.

2) edited GDP ratio of Germany to Canada because yes that data point was off

3) if y‚Äôall can‚Äôt handle some embellishment I can‚Äôt help you.  The NYC metro area is 23M people.  Canada has 38M.

ALCC to acquire OKLO Inc -- Sam Altman (CEO of Open AI) taking 10+ year old Nuclear Fission company public,108,1buyuj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1buyuj8/alcc_to_acquire_oklo_inc_sam_altman_ceo_of_open/,72,1712165925.0,"Gather round and follow me down this regarded trail, I stumbled upon this looking at midstream pipeline companies originally inspired by the PAA trade (and other companies) mentioned in a few posts on this sub recently.  I saw a press release that Diamondback Energy (FANG) had signed a letter of interest (non-binding) in small nuclear reactors to power remote oil/gas rigs in.  Small nuclear reactors would replace large diesel generators.

 [U.S. shale producers to reduce Permian drilling emissions, increase reliability with nucle](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2024/4/1/u-s-shale-drillers-to-reduce-permian-drilling-emissions-increase-reliability-with-nuclear-reactors/)

I've been interested in the small nuclear reactor trade for a few months since I learned about Centrus Energy (LEU).  So I looked into OKLO -- which turns out is about to go public via spac with ticker $ALCC it will trade under ticker $OKLO once merger is complete.  Sam Altman CEO of Open AI is Chairman of the board at OKLO and ALCC is his SPAC.

Details of the merger are here:

 [Oklo Inc. - Oklo, an Advanced Fission Technology Company, to Go Public via Merger with AltC Acquisition Corp.](https://oklo.com/newsroom/news-details/2023/Oklo-an-Advanced-Fission-Technology-Company-to-Go-Public-via-Merger-with-AltC-Acquisition-Corp/) 

Highlights of merger include a long lock up period and this merger is quoted as ""not being done to give early investors a chance to cash out.""  Transaction values Oklo at 850M (holds 516M in cash) and this transaction provides another 500M of capital for continued operations.  ALCC market cap today is 580M.  There is immediate value above todays trading price there. Merger is expected to go through in Q2 2024

Amendment to SEC Form S-4 was filed yesterday. Viewable here (maybe).  Multiple filings with SEC posted this week.    
 [XBRL Viewer (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm) 

Sam also put up 375M of the 500M recently raised by Helion-- a nuclear FUSION company--for larger scale applications.  They are not direct competitors because OKLO is focused on small FISSION reactors 15-50MW and Helion is focused on FUSION.  For reference, 15MW is enough to power about 3000 Single Family Homes.

 [Oklo Inc. - Home](https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx)  \-- lots of information on their website.

  
\--Oklo has been around since 2013.  They are going public to support the buildout of their facilities in Idaho and Ohio.    
\--Sam got involved in 2014 when he was president of Y combinator.  This is a bet on Sam, his knowledge, connections, and his belief that we will need nuclear power to support our AI ambitions.    
\--Technology used in the proposed Oklo reactor has been around since the 1960s.  This will help with regulatory approvals.   
\--Public and political opinions surrounding nuclear power are trending more favorable.  Meaning nuclear is still up for discussion regardless of who wins the election in November.  
\--We are continually consuming more and more power.  We will have to scale up our output somehow.  All signs are pointing to that additional power coming from nuclear.  


There is more to this but I am out of time. Discussion can continue later in the comments.

Everyone focuses on the foundry business being a money pit, but they're missing the bigger picture. Yes, it's massively capital intensive, but when you see those ""losses"" reported, think depreciation - not actual cash burn. It's accounting games to squeeze more government incentives.  The $7B loss is so overstated.

Could INTC dip a bit further? Maybe. But the downside seems limited, while $48 by summer-end feels very achievable as a first upside target. If it can reclaim and hold above $48, I'll double down on my position. Anything less and I'll probably cut and run.

The negative foundry narrative is obscuring the underlying progress.  Buy from here.   ",2024-04-03 17:57:00,2024-04-03 17:57:00+00:00

Powell also once again asserted that the Fed would maintain its independence during this red-hot election year, noting that its analysis is free from any ""personal or political bias.""

His comments about inflation marked the second time in the last week that Powell offered assurances that the overall outlook had not changed much despite some hotter-than-expected readings at the start of the year.

Question of the day: When your WING 2026 leap calls print and you‚Äôre sitting on $30 mil, what clothes are going to be perched on your back on your way to the Lambo dealership? 

Are you going to wear the rags that were donated to you after your stint in a garbage bin after you lost it all on 0DTE Spy calls? No. No you are not. You are only going to wear the cr√®me de la cr√®me. The best of the best. The mother of all fuckers. You are going to wear Zegna. One of the last independent Italian fashion houses that hasn‚Äôt been bought out by Kering or LVMH. 

Thanks to Chamath Papitalyatsdana and the SPAC craze of 2020, Zegna is now a publicly traded company after 100 years of business. They print money. They brought in $2.1 billion in revenue in 2023, a 28% increase from 2022. And their market cap is only $3.5B. 

You know those sexy Tom ford tuxedos? Guess who manufactures them? Zegna. They are a vertically integrated company which, because you regards don‚Äôt know, means that they control every part of their manufacturing process. From shaving the wool off the sheep to hanging their jackets in their flagship stores, they control the whole process. They also are focusing on that sustainable bullshit if that interests you. 

This is a company that is changing fashion. They  are revolutionizing what business casual means, focusing on modern over shirts, sneakers that can be worn dressed up or down (go down Wall Street and look at the ground. Every who‚Äôs who is wearing triple stitch‚Äôs). 

Have you seen succession? The show about that old guy who struggles with bladder issues and the other guy who swallows his own load? Everyone in that show is wearing Zegna. Roman Roy? He‚Äôs one of zegna‚Äôs new brand ambassadors. Jokes aside they are huge in China, huge in Europe, growing rapidly in the US, and are on an acquisition spree. With their manufacturing capabilities they are in a prime spot to become a real competitor to the Kering‚Äôs and LVMH‚Äôs of the world. Good luck regards.

* **ZIM Integrated Shipping Services**, often shortened to ZIM, is a major international cargo shipping company based in Israel.
   * The company offers a variety of ocean and air freight services, including refrigerated containers for delicate cargo [https://www.zim.com/](https://www.zim.com/).
   * ZIM also provides inland transportation by truck, rail, or barge, potentially offering door-to-door delivery [https://www.zim.com/](https://www.zim.com/).
   * With a global network and offices around the world, ZIM can handle complex logistics needs [https://zimlogistics.us/](https://zimlogistics.us/).
   * They are a subsidiary of ZIM Integrated Shipping and a wholly owned, independently operated company [https://zimlogistics.us/](https://zimlogistics.us/).

 

ZIM announced a dividend policy targeting  30-50% of annual net income to be distributed as dividends.

* **Recent:**  ZIM paid a dividend of $6.4 per share in April 2023
* **IN 2022**: Zim paid more than $25 in dividends

The last three quarters have not been profitable but the company is expected to be profitable when reporting on May 15th. This won't get them out of the woods, but it could be a catalyst for that idea and push the stock nicely north.  
 

* **Zacks**: Estimates ZIM to report earnings of **$0.94 per share** for the fiscal quarter ending May 2024 \[1\]. This represents a significant year-over-year increase of 288%.
* **TipRanks**: Forecasts a consensus EPS (earnings per share) of **$1.52** for the period ending in Q1 2024, Which is when ZIM reports Q1 - 2024

**Thesis:** The stock was beaten down on the back of the last three quarters, putting in a recent low of $9.09 on March 20th. The last three weeks it has found some solid accumulation. I think that could continue into the next quarterly report and push the price up to between $15-18 (35-75% upside)

Multiple Plays The Markets Are About To Notice,384,1bv2gti,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bv2gti/multiple_plays_the_markets_are_about_to_notice/,176,1712174132.0,"The obvious top play is $MU (Micron). 

This bad boy was overlooked while everyone stared at AI. The part that made it juicy is that it's a supportive play for AI. As those processors crunch bytes at amazing speeds, that data needs to come from somewhere and go somewhere else.

Storage is the big play here. 

They've almost sold out the next 2 years with locked in prices and deposits paid up front. There won't be any layoffs for the 43,000 full time employees. There's also a good chance they expand operations and go on a hiring spree.

You'll see some wild price swings as shorts do everything they can to get the f\*ck out of this one before shit really gets crazy.

Short term estimate: $200+ before settling down around $180 in the next 6 months.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up are $SPY and $IVV.

You can't really go wrong on this one. When the top holdings are mostly tech companies and Buffett uses it to win bets, arrogant shorts tend to get a little crazy and overstep their bounds quite often.

This is the mac daddy of ETF's and can't possibly lose in the long run.

If a stock performs poorly, it gets kicked to the curb and a new one gets introduced.

Right now though, in relation to shorts mistaking this for the year 1999, they've put themselves in a precarious position once again as tech companies actually have a plan this time.

Short term estimate: $530 by end of next week

Long term (EOY): $600+

A twin to this is $IVV. 

iShares Core S&P 500 ETF 

The holdings are the same as $SPY and will move in lock-step.

If one goes up or down, the other will do the same.

Here's a comparison of the 2:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/icv5sbuz4bsc1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5282af98c78843273eb97506b7749b25552f8d5

Price Estimate: Same as $SPY

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next play is $NVDA.

With new partnerships, sales and hype daily, shorts have completely f\*cked themselves on this one with nowhere to run. Averaging up is their only play because they aren't smart enough to take the loss.

I would say there's been enough information posted about them on here, so I'll cut this short and show you their current dark pool short position of $-97,038,220,000:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yfmgio9v5bsc1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc9a636756bf7dba6b0714898d23e53fb63f372

When this blows (very shortly), you're looking at an easy target of $1,400-$1,500 before settling in to $1,300 after the tears of Hedge Funds fill the streets.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up is $AMD.

Again, it comes up a lot in this sub but there's a few key things that don't.

The short position is over extended but most importantly, the recent hire of Thomas Zacharia is a bigger deal than people realize. 

He came from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In his 35 years there, he worked with industry leaders in tech, government, businesses and military.

By businesses, I'm not talking about Walmart. I mean the ones who design and build infrastructure.

‚ÄúThomas is a distinguished leader with decades of experience successfully creating public/private partnerships that have resulted in consistently deploying the world‚Äôs most powerful and advanced computing solutions, including the world‚Äôs fastest supercomputer Frontier‚Äù 

That quote alone, says a lot.

Not only can he call up the CEO of companies and world leaders, they'll answer the phone. The man has the world at his fingertips and now has AMD at his disposal.

Working at Oak Ridge would've been loaded with babysitting as they're responsible for the production of nuclear isotopes and funded by the Department of Energy.

Once this guy settles in, opens up his Rolodex, realizes his new found freedom, AMD will be well on its way.

Short term target (caused by a short explosion): $275

Long term with a solid dividend: $250 followed by a steady rise.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two that I'm grouping together are Joby Aviation (JOBY), Archer Aviation (ACHR). There are others but their market caps are too small at this point.

eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing*)* companies are going to be huge once they take off. 

&#x200B;

[Joby eVTOL](https://preview.redd.it/0xgynyxqhbsc1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e243094f0665f3d1a8cf7b17a69d40a7ec2e28a)

They won't be taking off until early 2025 and the earliest. This is due to FAA approval on what is a brand new technology that's about to hit the skies.

The appeal of this play is that these methods of travel are more nimble in urban environments than helicopters and cars.

Without the need for a runway, waiting at a gate and sniffing farts, you can be lifted straight into the air, skip over the city and be set down at your destination. 

This obviously won't be what the everyday citizen is using as a method of transportation. This will be bank executives, hedge fund managers, CEO's and politicians that need to move quickly. 

Other possible use cases are news channels that want to report on the traffic, weather and car chases. Police and emergency E-vac are definitely possibilities as well.

Both companies have already made deliveries to military installations and plan to deliver more. Think of the scene in Avatar when the Na'vi home gets obliterated.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z4denis5ebsc1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=3470e228f7d1a0f2fcad3b3b33a719b75d4bc3b0

With their current ranges of a couple hundred miles at a couple hundred miles and hour, they're perfect for city environments and short range operations. With the added benefit of being fully electric and quiet, they'll come with a much higher acceptance than you're current helicopter.

Here's the one thing that should be seriously noted on these:

# THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY!

As noted above, they can't make any income from sales until they receive FAA approval.

They're currently on stage 4 of 5. 

(1) certification basis

(2) planning and standards

(3) analysis and testing 

(4)  final decision and certification of design 

(5)  Showing and Verifying where the results of the testing are verified by the FAA. Upon successful completion of this stage, a type certification is issued. 

If the stock jumps at all before Q1, 2025, it will be hype at best and not hold. If you want to get in early, all good but you should be planning to have that cash tied up for a while.

With Toyota backing Joby and Daimler backing Archer, you know that these two (and others) have what they need to make this a reality.

Short term target: Nothing meaningful

Long term target: Only up

&#x200B;

I have OTM calls in most of the above plays. Nothing all that spectacular as I'm currently poor. This will change as the above list starts paying off.

I also have a Youtube channel where I hunt these down, show how I did it and call them out.

Rule 13 prevents linking it.

I'll have another list for you tomorrow. I'll limit these posts to 5 stocks per day moving forward so they're more in depth as ""currently unknown"" tickers come up.",2024-04-03 19:55:32,2024-04-03 19:55:32+00:00

NOSS- A middle-aged conspiracist that Gubbermint FUD doesn't want you to have. Capitalize on Boomer negligence.,5,1bv2s0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bv2s0g/noss_a_middleaged_conspiracist_that_gubbermint/,3,1712174850.0,"**Ncean Oower Sechnologies (NOSS):** Directly a result of hippies, founded in 1984, focusing on wave energy technology, is one of the older companies in the renewable energy sector, giving it a relatively long history to lock at;

NOSS's key technology capitalization is their PowerBuoy technology, converting kinetic energy from ocean waves into electricity. These buoys are deployed in various projects and collaborations worldwide, showcasing the potential of their technology.

**Future growth potential:** NOSS's success depends on several factors: Broader adoption of renewable energy sources; government policies supporting such initiatives; Me finally having the patience with reddit smug; and the competitiveness of their technology compared to other renewable energy sources (a fuckin given). It is to be noted that wave energy, while promising, is still a relatively small part of the renewable energy market; NOSS growth depends on their ability to scale effectively.

From a technical/fundamental basis, the likelihood of growth for NOSS is moderate to high, with respect to global policies increasingly focusing on renewable energy and the potential for wave energy to play a larger role in the future energy mix. Honestly, I know none of you give a shit about magic 8-ball writings on technicals and business basics in their sector -- so just remember: Either we jack up the # of renewable sources and NOSS does well -- or we do fuck-all and the tides become larger, stronger, and more-widespread: ultimately increasing the energy output per buoy, and NOSS does well. We call this a win-win situation (not here though, we all lose here). However, the timing of this growth is uncertain and depend on various external factors: regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market demand, yadayadaya.


----
Lets take a deeper look at the two sides:
----


**I'm a Bulltard:**

**Unique Technology:**

NOSS's PowerBuoy technology is unique and has the potential to become a leading solution for harnessing wave energy, which is a largely untapped renewable energy source. This is huge up-side as other innovators have significantly less data to run off, and these products can be sold globally as ... oceans are global...

**Growing Renewable Energy Market:**

With increasing focus on renewable energy, especially in the face of climate change concerns, NOSS stands to benefit from the growing market demand. The biggest crux here is the GOP pushing murica to be #1 on oil consumption, driving global initiative's away, but as said above -- higher tides means more energy-output/hr. which is a positive metric for NOSS.

**Partnerships and Collaborations:**

NOSS has secured partnerships and collaborations with various entities, including governments and research institutions, which could lead to further development and deployment of its technology.

**Enel Green Power:** NOSS partnered with Enel Green Power, a global renewable energy company, to develop and deploy a wave energy project off the coast of Chile. This project aims to demonstrate the commercial viability of NOSS technology.

**Department of Energy (DOE):** NOSS has received funding and support from the U.S. Department of Energy for the development and deployment of its wave energy technology. The DOE has recognized NOSS's technology as a promising renewable energy solution.

**Lockheed Martin:** NOSS partnered with Lockheed Martin to develop a wave energy project off the coast of Australia. This project aims to demonstrate the integration of wave energy with existing offshore infrastructure.

**Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA):** NOSS received funding from ARENA to support the development of its wave energy technology in Australia. This funding has helped accelerate the deployment of PowerBuoy units in Australian waters.

**European Union:** NOSS has received funding from the European Union to support the development and deployment of its wave energy technology in European waters. This funding has helped expand NOSS's presence in the European market.

These also provide validation of NOSS's technology and its potential to become a leading solution for wave energy generation.

**Potential for Scalability:**

If NOSS can successfully scale up its operations and deploy its technology in larger projects, it could significantly increase its revenue and market share.

**I'm a Bearturd:**

**Technological Challenges:** Developing and deploying wave energy technology presents significant technological challenges, including durability in harsh marine environments and cost-effectiveness compared to other renewable energy sources. Luckily NOSS is the master in their sector for this, so fuck what they say.

**Regulatory and Permitting Hurdles:** Obtaining permits for deploying ocean-based energy systems can be complex and time-consuming, which could delay or hinder NOSS's projects. Luckily, again, NOSS has their fingies in multiple govt. agencies globally with validated data. This shit ain't hard for them to wriggle in deeper.

**Market Competition:** NOSS faces competition from other renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, which are more established and have lower technological and regulatory barriers. This is likely the biggest bear case, but there are many studies to show that utilizing all renewables is the best and maybe only way to completely decouple from non-renewables.

**Financial Stability:** As a relatively small company, NOSS may face financial challenges in scaling up its operations and competing with larger, more established players in the renewable energy market, but this honestly is more of a bullish point than not. They have managed to leverage themselves into the weaves of politico-babymama's and given opportunity can leverage themselves to be highly scalable with supporting policy.

**Upside Potential:** The bullish case for NOSS is way better, just read what the fuck I wrote.

-----
Don't believe me? Here's the numbers:
----

**Technology Potential:** NOSS's PowerBuoy technology has been successfully deployed in various projects, including grid-connected and autonomous systems. These deployments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the technology. NOSS's PowerBuoy technology has achieved over 125,000 hours of cumulative ocean testing, demonstrating its durability and effectiveness in real-world conditions.

**Project Pipeline:** NOSS has a strong project pipeline, with ongoing and planned projects in different parts of the world. These projects indicate growing interest and demand for wave energy solutions. NOSS has a pipeline of projects with a potential capacity of over 450 megawatts (MW), including projects in the United States, Australia, and Europe. These projects represent a significant growth opportunity for the company.

**Partnerships and Collaborations:** NOSS has secured partnerships and collaborations with governments, research institutions, and industry players. These partnerships not only provide validation for NOSS's technology but also open up opportunities for further development and deployment. I won't provide the details of the contract sizes, but this shit is public info and any of you can look it up. I'm already doing a lot here..

**Financial Performance:** While NOSS has had fluctuations in its financial performance, it has shown signs of improvement in recent years. For example, in its most recent quarterly report, NOSS reported increased revenue and a narrower net loss compared to the previous year; NOSS reported total revenue of $1.5 million, an increase of 217% compared to the same quarter last year. The company also reported a net loss of $3.7 million, an improvement from a net loss of $4.5 million in the previous year. Obviously this isn't great, but what it is is an opportunity to get on a ship turning with tides, not against.

**Market Potential:** The global wave energy market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by increasing investments in renewable energy and the need to reduce carbon emissions. NOSS, with its unique technology, is well-positioned to capitalize on this market growth. The global wave energy market is projected to reach $107.4 million by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3% from 2020 to 2027. With its unique technology, NOSS is well-positioned to capitalize on this market growth.

**Competitive Position:** While NOSS faces competition from other renewable energy sources, NOSS's PowerBuoy technology offers advantages such as continuous power generation, scalability, and minimal environmental impact compared to other renewable energy sources. This competitive positioning could help NOSS capture a significant share of the market.

-----
So, what is the fair price of NOSS from a technical standpoint
----

Where the fuck do you think we are? TA? That's a load of horse shit. All this shit below - you don't need to understand any of it.

~~Trend Analysis: Price trends can help identify whether the stock is in an uptrend, downtrend, or trading range. This information can be used to determine the direction of the stock's future price movement. Support and Resistance Levels: Identifying key support (price level where buying interest is expected to be strong) and resistance (price level where selling pressure is expected to be strong) levels can help determine entry and exit points for trades. Moving Averages: Using moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, can help identify trends and potential reversal points. Volume Analysis: Analyzing trading volume can help confirm price trends. A surge in volume can indicate a strong trend, while low volume can indicate a weak or reversing trend. Relative Strength Index (RSI): RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. An RSI above 70 indicates the stock may be overbought, while an RSI below 30 indicates the stock may be oversold. Fibonacci Retracement Levels: Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. These levels are based on the Fibonacci sequence and are used to identify potential reversal points.~~

But say you're a **schewb** and care about this nonsense...

**Moving Averages:** Let's assume NOSSs 50-day moving average (MA) is $5.00 and its 200-day MA is $4.50. A common strategy is to consider the crossover of these moving averages as a signal. If the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, it could signal a bullish trend, and vice versa for a bearish trend.

**Support and Resistance Levels:** Suppose NOSS has established strong support at $4.50 and resistance at $6.00 based on historical price data. These levels can be used as reference points for potential price targets.

**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Assuming NOSS's RSI is currently at 45, which is neither overbought nor oversold. A higher RSI could indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential price decrease, while a lower RSI could indicate oversold conditions, suggesting a potential price increase.

But like I said, this is all bullshit... Just listen to your heart. These numbers are theoretical or backwards looking. useless.

TL;DR: I have shares on this Grandpa about to hit that retirement pussy

4) wait for a $5 to $7 dip or a 0.3% to 1.5% dip before you buy in. 
5) max risk for a position is 30% of account - absolutely nothing more than this. 
6) look to take profit if more than 40% profit, and look to sell if more than %40 loss

Citi analyst says quake may shift leverage in price negotiations ‚Äúto memory makers‚Äù ... Q2 prices for DRAM could rise by double-digits vs Q1,1,1bv53jv,https://www.barrons.com/articles/taiwan-quake-chip-prices-31bb33af?siteid=yhoof2,2,1712180214.0,"Relevant portions of the article:

>Early indications suggest the damage to Taiwan-based chip factories from the earthquake were modest. But the quake comes at a time when a rebound in memory demand and a severe shortage of capacity for producing the high-end processors used in generative artificial intelligence applications have highlighted the global fragility of the semiconductor industry.
> 
>The memory-chip producer Micron Technology, which has multiple fabs in Taiwan, said in a statement that all of its staff there have been accounted for and reported safe. Micron said it is ‚Äúevaluating impact to our operations and supply chain,‚Äù and will communicate changes in delivery commitments to customers after that process is completed ‚Ä¶ **The chip-industry research firm TrendForce said that so far, it has found no reports of significant equipment damage at Taiwanese fabs. The research firm noted that Nvidia chips are produced in TSMC‚Äôs fab in the Southern Taiwan Science Park, where personnel weren‚Äôt evacuated.** While there were short shutdowns for equipment inspection, TrendForce said, the impact on Nvidia‚Äôs chip supply should be minimal.
> 
>**Citi analyst Peter Lee said in a research note that Taiwan accounts for about 15% of global DRAM capacity. He thinks disruptions tied to the quake could shift leverage in current contract price negotiations ‚Äúfrom the clients to memory makers.‚Äù He thinks prices for DRAM in the quarter could result in double-digit price increases from their first[1]quarter levels.**
> 
>**TrendForce said that Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix, have all halted discussions regarding pricing for DRAM to reassess following the earthquake.**
> 
>Citi‚Äôs Laura Chen said that in 2016, a quake of magnitude 6.6 resulted in a hit to revenue of about 1% for Taiwan Semiconductor, with a gross margin impact of 2% to 3%. She thinks the impact will be minor this time.
> 
>‚ÄúTSMC has implemented rigorous earthquake production measures that go beyond legal requirements,‚Äù Chen wrote. ‚ÄúThese initiatives include thorough inspections of building facilities, installation of dampers to enhance structural integrity, and the adoption of cutting[1]edge earthquake resistance technologies and methodologies to mitigate risks.‚Äù",2024-04-03 21:36:54,2024-04-03 21:36:54+00:00

Engineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the skunk-works project is private. The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.

Though the effort is still in the beginning stages ‚Äî and it‚Äôs unclear if the products will ultimately be released ‚Äî Apple is under growing pressure to find new sources of revenue. It scrapped an electric vehicle project in February, and a push into mixed-reality goggles is expected to take years to become a major moneymaker.

I wanted in at same price but market was closed so I added the option into my watchlist and waited for a good entry. Today I saw that it has gone up 350% within a week.

I know we are all restated here, but some of you really put time into these good DD just to die in new (keep doing it pls, it makes me money). I saw another good DD on VRT (it‚Äôs up 5% today). 

It would be nice to have a system where we can reward people who put time into this. Something like a leaderboard.
