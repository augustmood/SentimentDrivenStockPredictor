JPoww Contemplations,0,1byjwrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byjwrc/jpoww_contemplations/,4,1712535518.0,"Seems like this past week has reawakened a bunch of hibernating ghey berrs ‚Äî saw what looked like one next to the Wendy‚Äôs trash cans when I was out this morning.

Now, outside of Iran-Israel‚Äôs usual regarded crap and Fed‚Äôs Imhotep deciding he wants to give that shiny dome of his a day under the media sun, I‚Äôm struggling to reconcile these red dildo foaming going around here with the one that JPoww gave off last FOMC/Easter Friday.

So bored on a Sunday and in my usual regarded spirit, I got thinking what I‚Äôd do in this situation if I were JPoww. It seems likely that inflation is gonna continue to print, so a June rate cut sounds more and more hard to justify.

But would I really risk releasing red dildos in an election year when the opposing running candidate understands as much about inflation/measured federal spending as actual Imhotep did? One who‚Äôs openly criticized JPoww and would print to death? All for what ‚Äî not risking prematurely cutting rates by ONE or two QUARTER % pts? I wouldn‚Äôt. Remember regards, last year this market expected 7 and now we‚Äôre somehow down to 3 and yet at ATHs.
 
*TLDR:*: hey berrs never learn, JPoww will choose lesser of the two evils between ‚Äútransitory‚Äù inflation and risking the release of red dildos in an election year.

GE aerospace, after having spun off, is now less than 10% off from its valuation when it was still valued with GE Vernova.

It‚Äôs BY FAR at the highest price to sales ratio it‚Äôs ever traded at and is at one of the highest PE ratio not counting periods of non profitability.

Its dividend is non existent at less than 1% and that‚Äôs after upping it by 250%.

Its earnings and sales are both down despite the 67% spike in the past year in stock price

Aerospace as a sector is going to get hit hard by  the economic slowdown (notice I didn‚Äôt say recession, I said slowdown.  Economy doesn‚Äôt need to crash for aerospace to tumble)

$CGC/ACB - Cost to borrow for short/short shares available,1,1byks33,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byks33/cgcacb_cost_to_borrow_for_shortshort_shares/,2,1712537961.0,"Something interesting came up when taking a look at CGC's available short shares and their cost to borrow. Back when CGC had their run up in September of 2023, the fee to borrow shares were 120% at its height, however now the cost to borrow to short it is at 488%. This is a huge cost to short, in hindsight shorts are being left to cover at these extremes costs, however CGC hasn't even hit the $ levels of September 2023. Shares available to short is also extremely low, barely any to none to be able to borrow.

ACB is also worth taking a look at, I believe they are next to run up with their fee to borrow shares to short increasing steadily and the shares available to short is getting lower as the share price goes up. After ACB/CGC both went through the stock splits, seems like it might be worth taking a look at. Unfortunately TLRY has too many shares outstanding, so I believe they won't have the extreme moves as both CGC/ACB since their fee to borrow shares are still the same and won't change in terms of shares available to short from the big outstanding shares available. Regardless I think TLRY will follow alongside CGC/ACB moves, but watch carefully with cannabis related names in terms of the fee to borrow shares and short shares available, we are seeing levels we have not seen before.

LULU, TSLA, MCD all reported the consumer sharply pulling back recently. Does the average American board the plane to Miami when they can't afford their favorite butt shaped yoga pants, payment on a model 3, or the big breakfast meal? ü§î 

The Boeing blowouts were given extensive media coverage. Fear of flying is one if the most common phobias. Perhaps our friends in LA would rather just drive to Vegas rather than take the short flight simply cuz ""If it's Boeing, I'm not going"". 

Oil prices are pissing through the rooftops. Delta has some mitigation to energy prices compared to other airlines, but it's still bad for them. Iran is apparently scheduled to attack Israel or US assets in the ME pretty soon too so that's probably not gonna help things there. Powell is also dead set on cutting rates even though manufacturing and employment are still experiencing a Renaissance, so that just stimulates energy demand even more.  

Bonus reason: DAL is near the price it was the last time it went back into the shit hole. 

I predict about a 5-6 dollar drop from the open on Monday. 4/12 put options at the money were about 1.40 on Friday's close. I rarely play earnings, but this setup seems pretty good so I'm gonna take a shot at it.

**CPI:**

* CPI is likely to come in about 10 basis points under consensus expectations per my model.
* Despite a hot jobs report and rising gas prices, productivity gains and a slowing pace of rent/rent equivalent increases will keep CPI in check.
* This could put rate cuts back on the table.
* If this thesis holds, expect the Russell 2000 (RUT) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) to rally.

**Banks:**

* JPM may kick off a bank rally.
* If the inflation thesis holds, banks will start to look awfully cheap as earnings come through.

**Tech Names:**

* Not every stock will move up - track the fundamentals.
* GOOG and AAPL are likely to outperform NVDA.
* META and NFLX looking pretty solid in the short term.
* Look for unloved tech names that have been left behind due to the AI hype (e.g. AAPL).
* Cybersecurity and IT services companies are expected to benefit.
* Non-AI chip companies offer a safer downside play with potential upside.

**Energy/Utilities:**

* The oil sector is getting crowded, so target utilities and natural gas exposure instead.

There may be some pockets to short, like Boeing or Tesla, but be cautious and use stop losses, as these names could get caught up in a broader market rally.  Time to buy, buy, buy!

After three years of working an average of 52hrs  per week, just so I can keep throwing money into the market. I started as I'm sure most you reading this, with a few thousands hopping to get a homerun. My first year was a total loss, at one point I was up $2000 but that was it. Second year was around the same but now It took me longer to the money, I've learned from a few mistakes but still not profitable.  This year I've finally developed a strategy that seens to be profitable but my lack of discipline and rush to recover my losses stopped me from taking gains, and keeping them once I made them. My username reveals my mindset at the time  I started trading, today that username is just a curse mark and constant reminder of the  cause for all my failures.  I have decided to trade my last 4000 (thanks to my tax returns), no more yolos, no more deposits. This time is the last time, either I make all my money back in the next three years, or I loose it all and burn in flames. I hope this post serves to inspire those that might be we I am, or on the way there, to reconsider your decisions and thier consequences, and hopefully evolve from degenerate gambler to regenerate trader.

we all know of the deep connections between big business and government. the corporatism that we cannot stop but only profit from. there‚Äôs a revolving door between government and big corporations. 

all this is established. except for some reason, crypto nerds seem to think they are being targeted by the government. they buy into the lie. 

all the big fish have their positions in crypto. the SEC is suing and losing ON PURPOSE, in order to create *legal precedent.* The only thing more powerful than the law in this country is legal precedent. 

If they do these cases now and lose, they create legal clarity for Coinbase, Blackrock‚Äôs ETF, crypto in general.

And they have crypto kids convinced they‚Äôre being targeted. It‚Äôs all a fa√ßade. They keep losing in the courts because that is the agenda. The point is to lose because their friends are ready to profit.

Preliminary Analysis UnitedHealth Inc. (NYSE:UNH),9,1byon16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,19,1712549459.0,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

Arbitrage Play: Iranian Rial,1,1bytzqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bytzqm/arbitrage_play_iranian_rial/,1,1712570204.0,"So I just read an article that said Iran's currency, the Rial has fallen since yesterday about 30%.  Being a Westerner degen, my mind immediately went to 1) how to profit off of this and 2) in the process of shorting the currency to stick it to the bastards (make Moolahüíµ by fucking the Mullahüë≥üïå).

So I opened up and took a look at the historical trend of the IRR:USD forex rates and I was astonished to not see any changes.   **1 USD = 42,082.9 IRR** as of now.  And over the past several years this number has stayed astonishingly static always around 42k.  However, according to the article, the ACTUAL value of the currency is more like **1 USD = 660,000 IRR!!!**  

So it seems their central bank is HEAVILY manipulating the currency in the public markets.  If this was any normal country I'd have a few ideas how to exploit this but given the level of corruption in Iran and the numerous financial sanctions they're under, I don't have any concrete ideas how to take advantage of the huge discrepancy between the official rate and the open market rate.

"The High Risk, High Reward of BCAN - A Deep Dive into Biocannabis Innovation",1,1byu1ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byu1ak/the_high_risk_high_reward_of_bcan_a_deep_dive/,2,1712570380.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, degenerates of all ages, gather around as we dive deep into the world of biocannabis with BCAN. This isn‚Äôt your grandpa‚Äôs investment; it‚Äôs a rocket ship with the potential to moon, equipped with high volatility and the promise of substantial rewards. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a gathering of information to light our way through the financial darkness.

Company Overview

BCAN has emerged as a trailblazer in the biocannabis industry, combining cutting-edge biotechnology with cannabis cultivation to develop innovative products that aim to revolutionize medical marijuana and recreational cannabis use. Their focus on genetically modified strains promises higher yields, greater potency, and medical strains designed to treat specific conditions.

Financial Health

Looking at BCAN‚Äôs financials, we see a company at the cusp of profitability. With a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio and increasing revenue streams from both the medical and recreational sectors, BCAN is positioning itself as a lean, mean, growth machine. However, it‚Äôs essential to note the speculative nature of this investment; while the rewards can be substantial, the risks are equally significant.

Market Potential

The global cannabis market is on a high, projected to reach unprecedented values in the coming years. BCAN‚Äôs innovative approach positions it uniquely in this burgeoning market, with the potential to capture significant market share. Their investment in R&D could lead to groundbreaking products that attract a loyal customer base.

Risks and Challenges

No investment comes without its risks, and BCAN is no exception. Regulatory hurdles remain a significant obstacle, with the legal landscape of cannabis constantly evolving. Additionally, competition is fierce, and BCAN must continue to innovate to stay ahead. There‚Äôs also the risk of volatility; the cannabis sector is known for its dramatic price swings, which could lead to potential losses.

Technical Analysis

A glance at BCAN‚Äôs chart shows a company on the brink of a breakout. With increasing volume and bullish indicators, the technical analysis suggests a potential uptrend. However, it‚Äôs crucial to approach with caution; the market‚Äôs sentiment can change rapidly, especially in sectors as volatile as biocannabis.

Conclusion

In conclusion, BCAN represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that could appeal to the degenerates of WallStreetBets. With its innovative approach to the cannabis industry, financial health, and market potential, BCAN could very well be the next rocket to the moon. However, remember the golden rule: never invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. The path to riches is fraught with peril, but for those willing to take the risk, the rewards could be substantial.

TL;DR

BCAN = Biocannabis innovation. High risk, high reward. Financially healthy with huge market potential",2024-04-08 09:59:40,2024-04-08 09:59:40+00:00
