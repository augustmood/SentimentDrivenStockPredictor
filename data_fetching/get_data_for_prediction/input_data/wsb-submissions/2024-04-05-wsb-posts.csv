Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said interest-rate cuts may not be needed this year if progress on inflation stalls, especially if the economy remains robust.

‚ÄúIn March I had jotted down two rate cuts this year if inflation continues to fall back towards our 2% target,‚Äù Kashkari said in a virtual event on Thursday. ‚ÄúIf we continue to see inflation moving sideways, then that would make me question whether we needed to do those rate cuts at all.‚Äù

SGML, is Sigma Lithium. They just announced after earnings that they are looking to double production. Construction begins this month. They already have the capital required to get it built.

What do they make? EV batteries. Who drives places? Everybody. It's simple. Cars don't work without batteries. Tesla just got rocked by that Chinese company who is selling their cars cheaper. Maybe they've got a better battery supplier. Maybe it's SGML. Maybe not but who knows.

Either way, gains.

"In one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year, the S&P500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a few hours. Here's why.",3073,1bw69sq,https://i.redd.it/cx6fsc3kkksc1.png,246,1712283028.0,"[Original](https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/dramatic-shift-in-market-takes-everyone-by-surprise)

Thursday was supposed to be a quiet session as market participants awaited the very important March jobs report, which will be released Friday morning. Instead, it turned into one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year.

The day started with a gap-up open mainly due to chatter that there is weakness in the job market and that there is a good likelihood that the March jobs news may be softer than expected and trigger a Fed rate cut in June. It was a questionable premise, but it created a little squeeze action and some underlying support.

Later in the day, headlines hit that Fed member Kashkari commented that ‚Äúif inflation continues to move sideways, it makes me wonder if we should cut rates at all this year.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first hawkish comment from a Fed member, and it probably wouldn‚Äôt have had too much of an impact, but then some other more dramatic news hit.

In Tel Aviv, Israel, residents were confused when their GPS applications showed that they were located in Lebanon. The reason was that the Israeli military was scrambling GPS signals in preparation for a possible drone attack by Iran. Reports circulated that Israel sees indications that Iran may launch missile/drone attacks from Iranian territory, possibly on Friday. Israeli officials informed the U.S. that an Iranian attack would trigger a response.

This news caused oil to spike higher, defense contractors to rally, and the market to sell steadily into the close.

The S&P 500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a matter of a few hours. This has only happened four other times before, according to Jason Goepfert.

It was a dramatic shift and caught almost everyone by surprise. Sharp intraday reversals are often major turning points.

We still have the jobs news to deal with Friday morning, and we will see if there actually is an attack on Israel, but the market is now very unsettled. Volatility has spiked, and there should be a major shift in sentiment as a result of this action.

I‚Äôll have more in the morning prior to the jobs news, but that report now has the capacity to accelerate a correction that has been anticipated for several months.

Have a good evening. I‚Äôll see you Friday.

Edit: Kashkari started speaking at 2pm, when the markets were already crashing. Also, the US10Y did not shoot up but dropped instead.

Have you seen the Bird Flu? 

Ok now stay with me here. Before we get to tin foil hat predictions and whatnot, let‚Äôs just talk about what‚Äôs going on. Bird Flu has been found in beef, eggs, and chicken (yeah technically the same thing but the actual birds not just the eggs you feel me?) - also, someone in Texas has tested positive for it.

In the past few days the mainstream media has begun reporting on the Bird Flu. The European CDC has issued a statement about how it‚Äôs dangerous. 

Hypothetically, let‚Äôs say pandemic 2.0 rolls around. In this one your food will not be safe. People will be scared their chicken, eggs, and beef - maybe more animals down the line - may have the virus. 

Insert - $BYND - yes, beyond your wildest imagination, you can have meatless meat. You think soy and that other vegan shit can catch viruses? Nope. This will be like the toilet paper rush in the early covid days. Everyone will hoard the virus-safe meat.

Gogoro Q1 Recap,10,1bweenz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bweenz/gogoro_q1_recap/,10,1712311953.0,"**Q1 Scooter Sales in Taiwan**

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**International Recognition**

March 19: Gogoro Named by Fast Company as Asia-Pacific‚Äôs #1 Most Innovative Company of 2024 and #37 Most Innovative Company Globally.

Fast Company is a highly respected publication, and this award further underscores Gogoro's recent recognition (Oct 4, 2023) by the MIT Technology Review, affirming its status as an innovative company and a key player in climate technology worth monitoring.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

This shows the minimum projection of AMD price for the investment being profitable.

Higher Oil/Gas will push for greater EV adoption. ,0,1bwj80w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwj80w/higher_oilgas_will_push_for_greater_ev_adoption/,51,1712326763.0,"High oil prices are creating a favorable environment for EV adoption by making EVs more attractive over ICE.

1. Oil prices are going higher, much higher mainly because of the middle east conflict and Russian cutting output. Ukraine is also attacking Russia's refineries putting them out of service. My thought is oil prices will get to $100+ if Iran retaliates and Saudi's don't boost production to make up the difference. Also the Strategic Petroleum reserves are being used and not refilled, we may reach a point when reserves get super low. This is good for US oil companies though.
2. There is economic incentives for EV's none for ICE. People who buy new electric vehicles may be eligible for a tax credit as high as $7,500, and used electric car buyers may qualify for up to $4,000. California residents get extra incentives. We are in a election year, we may see more incentives if oil gets out of control.
3. last month Biden issued an executive order to speed up the elimination of ICE cars and push for more EV adoption. This would create a rotation out of ICE cars and into EV's. This comes at a bad time as GM and Ford are scaling back EV production.

I think things in the middle east will escalate so will things with Russia/NATO. This will push oil prices to very high levels and will lead to a EV rush. Tesla's inventory should shrink as prices are super low.  All commodities are going higher right now.

Some mad-man assigned a chunk of my lower-leg credit bear spread of DJT,73,1bwjcds,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwjcds/some_madman_assigned_a_chunk_of_my_lowerleg/,63,1712327072.0,"Story time! So, I wanted to make some tendies from the obvious pending implosion of DJT, but with option premiums being absurd, I decided to sell a bear credit spread on Wednesday:

Upper leg - bought 47.5 Call 5/17 x10  
Lower leg - sold 32.5 Call 5/17 x10

I got $9k credit for it, so, if no assignments happened, max pain was $6k loss and max profit was $9k. Since there was a 99.9% probability of DJT tanking, I thought this was a pretty good deal.

On Thursday, some psycho exercised 7 of of my 10 lower legs and assigned me a -700 short position, basically handing my about $3500 premium for free... then I rolled the upper leg for those to a closer strike and further OTM just to keep some insurance on the position and got back another \~$3500  while keeping my short. Then I sold some April 19th 45P's for $6.75 a pop (which may have been premature, but that premium looked very juicy).

I figure I can eat the borrowing fee for now and offset it with all the premiums I've collected while watching this dumpster fire go down.

Now, why the FUCK would anyone exercise 5/17 32.5C's on this garbage with so much time left on these? Are they just wanting to hold this crap long term and collect the borrowing fees or something? Just makes no sense why they'd burn so much premium to hold those shares.

Thanks for listening! Current DJT positions:

How can I profit off of the Texas solar eclipse on 4/8?,0,1bwjsl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwjsl3/how_can_i_profit_off_of_the_texas_solar_eclipse/,64,1712328180.0,"Hello fellow regards,

For those who don't know, there is going to be a somewhat significant solar eclipse in Texas this Monday. Every university/school in the area has canceled class for the day, and the media is telling people to stock up on food and water like there's gonna be an apocalypse, because Texas is expecting ""millions of tourists and visitors"" that plan on viewing the eclipse. In fact at this very moment nearly every hotel in Central Texas is fully booked.   

Surely there must be some public Texan company that is printing at this very moment, right? Someone HAS to be making tons of profit that I can leech on as a result of this phenomenon.

Today marked green for the year after being down huge,107,1bwlo5x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bwlo5x,45,1712332816.0,"Started the year by shitting my pants perpetually. It culminated in February when I lost over 3k in just two days. For context I usually keep between 5-8k in my account so it was really upsetting. 

I was down to 3.9k at the end of February and decided I either needed to quit trading or pull my head out of my ass and take real setups with half decent risk management.  

Fast forward to today I'm on fire. I've withdrawn 4.5k from my account to pay off all my debt and am now starting anew with a small balance. The plan is usually to aim for 100 or 200 a day, but I can hardly help it when I just get super lucky sometimes like today when I had decided 170 was a decent spot to buy a put for TSLA earnings and it just randomly plummeted a couple bucks and gave me a +100%, which I just took profit on cuz it's a nice win. It continued much lower and then randomly gapped up 8 bucks a little later so I don't really fault myself at all for not getting every inch of gains cuz greed is obviously punished often with options trading. 

The goal is to just keep grinding up and build the account by limiting losses and ending the day when I'm up 100 or 200 and I don't see obvious opportunities anymore. The open on QQQ is usually my best trade of any day. I scalp TSLA, COIN, and NVDA at support and resistance and jump into trends.",2024-04-05 16:00:16,2024-04-05 16:00:16+00:00

Food for thought - CCL - 5/17 $16c,23,1bwmn4k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bwmn4k,32,1712335161.0,"You‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôve gathered you all here today. 

CCL has had a positive operating profit for four straight quarters. Last month CCL reported its first-quarter earnings, for the period that ended Feb 29. Not only did revenue totaling $5.4 billon rise 22% year over year, but bookings are at all time highs. In Q1 customer deposits topped $7B, which is higher than the previous posted bookings last year at $5.7B

Around 12.46M passengers in 2023. Booking numbers suggest that unlike other industries, the cruise business might be inflation resistant since it caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, cruising companies are particularly resilient to recessions, as you can observe in the graphs for the Worldwide Cruise Industry Passengers and Carnival Total Passengers. During the 2008 recession, the total cruise passenger volume remained steady and continued to increase AND CCL plans to expand capacity berths by nearly 5,000 by 2025.

In 2023 there were an estimated 31.5M passengers in the worldwide cruise industry and is expected to increase to 39.5M by 2027, which means an annual growth in passengers of 6.34% through 2027. CCL also holds a 39.5% market share, ahead of RCL and NCLH.

CCL has a large enough fleet to operate at lower margins and therefore offer lower fares. Any new company willing to offer to cruise for the middle class would need to focus on luxury cruising because it will not be able to compete in pricing with CCL nor with RCL. This same thing applies to cruise companies with smaller market shares. 

RCL has also beat earning estimates the past four quarters and their Q1 ER is 5/2 P/M. NCLH has beat earnings 3/4 (missing in Q4) and Q1 ER coming P/M 4/29. I expect a beat on both and expect a slight move between the three for each ER. Out of the three CCL is HIGHLY undervalued compared to the others and expect a little more traffic coming in. Excellent value play/long term hold. 



-CON-
CCL‚Äôs long-term debt sits at $28.5B which is a big reason many investors are wary about investing in the stock right now. 

-HOWEVER-

During last quarter CCL‚Äôs operating cashflow was a positive $1.8B, which is a huge improvement from the $400M this time last year. 

CCL released three new cruise ships for its Excel Class from 2021 and 2023. They announced a new 180,000 ton ship order for 2027. Weinstein stated, ‚ÄúOur responsible capital approach will support utilizing our substantial free cash flow over the next several years to strategically improve our balance sheet, significantly reduce our leverage levels and continue to transfer value from debt holders to shareholders‚Äù

Short SkyWest Regional Airlines ($SKYW),16,1bwncjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwncjr/short_skywest_regional_airlines_skyw/,19,1712336914.0,"Abstract:

Short SkyWest Regional Airlines ($SKYW)

SkyWest stock has been on a tear for the past year, almost entirely because they used a decent amount of cash on their books to buy back an extremely large amount of shares in an unprecedented stock buyback. This stock buyback program will soon end, and SKYW stock will drop by \~50%.

Details:

SKYW announced in Winter 2022 that they were going to buy back $381 million worth of stock. However, at the time, the market cap. of SKYW was only \~$800 million, i.e. their buyback program was equal to almost 50% of their market cap and in the beginning, they were buying 10% of all shares traded for any given day. For comparison, this would be as if Apple announced a $1.3 trillion share buyback program. and was buying billions of dollars of shares a day. As such, this unprecedented buyback program sent the stock skyrocketing, far above a fair price, with a PE ratio of 80, for a non-growing airline, while other airlines have been roughly flat during this period (see the ETF $JETS)

  
However, that share buyback program is almost over. Considering that SKYW is now at an all time high, with oil prices as high as they are, once their buying pressure ceases in the near future I expect SKYW to drop such that it's overall performance over this time period will have mirrored other airlines, i.e. the share price will go back to the $20-$30 range compared to its current price of $70.

The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.

Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies.¬†

However, Alphabet must be **careful** as big tech companies have faced major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.

The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google‚Äôs ad business. The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.

To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer. Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it **difficult** to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.

DD on the DJT lock-up - YOLOing back on the Trump Train,21,1bwoapp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwoapp/dd_on_the_djt_lockup_yoloing_back_on_the_trump/,184,1712339253.0,"Like many, I bought in on DJT early last week, but I was soft and bought shares instead of call options. Still turned out very well (gain porn attached), but could have been so much more.

I've been looking for another bite of the apple and I think I've found something based on a deep dive of the DJT SEC filings.

I am a securities lawyer who reads SEC filings for fun, so I feel obligated to say that¬†**this is in no way legal or investment advice**.

Everyone and their mom is either short or heavily into puts on this dogshit company. As we are all aware, they had $4 million of revenue in 2023. The company itself is worthless.

However, the borrow cost is outrageous. (see¬†[https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240403272/why-shorting-trumps-djt-stock-could-cost-you-500](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240403272/why-shorting-trumps-djt-stock-could-cost-you-500)). If the stock isn't actively dropping, shorts are getting killed by the borrow cost. I've read that¬†**it costs $20/share/month to borrow this POS**.

The company already released their (abysmal) full year 2023 earnings, and yet the stock is still hanging on - trading in the $40s when everyone knows the true worth based on the business outlook is like $0-1 per share. Clearly bad financial and operational news is irrelevant.

**If you are short you are losing $20/month on the borrow.**¬†Due to the borrow cost, I have to think that¬†**anyone who is currently short (or has April-May puts) is banking on a near term price drop trigger: Donald Trump unloading his shares.**

Now, if you did the first level of due diligence and read the individual lock-up agreements, filed with the SEC, you would notice that the company can basically waive the lock-up at will:

**Lock-Up Agreements**

Here is Donald Trump's actual individual lock-up agreement, filed with his 13D this past Monday:¬†[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/947033/000114036124017051/ef20025668\_ex99-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/947033/000114036124017051/ef20025668_ex99-2.htm)

- It says that he can't sell his shares, or pledge his shares for a loan (which many have incorrectly suggested he could do to monetize his stake).

- Waivers and amendments require the consent of the company, and of Eric Swider, as the Purchaser CEO Representative. See Section 2(g).

- Eric Swider is a Board member of DJT. So basically, if the Board (including Swider) agrees, the lock-up can be waived.

With it being so easy to waive the lock-up, I think the shorts have priced in that a lock-up waiver is coming, and likely sooner rather than later.

**HOWEVER**, and I don't see that really anyone has picked up on this:

**Lock-Up in the Company Charter**

There is ALSO a lock-up in the company's certificate of incorporation that applies to Donald Trump's shares. See Section 4.8 of the certificate of incorporation they just filed with their 10-K:¬†[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124016719/ef20025342\_ex3-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124016719/ef20025342_ex3-2.htm)

- Section 4.8 basically mirrors the lock-up provisions in the individual lock-up agreements - no stock sales, no stock pledges for loans, etc.

- Why is this supplemental lock-up in the certificate of incorporation (which is very unusual btw) a big deal if it just says what is already in the individual lock-up agreements?

**Here's why: A company's certificate of incorporation \*cannot be waived or amended by the Board\*. It can only be amended by a vote of the shareholders.**

- Even though Donald Trump owns >50% of the shares, Section 7.3 says that the shareholders cannot take action by written consent, so¬†**any amendment or waiver would have to be proposed and voted on at a formal special meeting of shareholders**.

- Under Delaware law, you have to give at least 10 days advance notice of a shareholders' meeting, and fully describe the meeting proposals to the shareholders.

You can imagine what would happen to the DJT stock price if a shareholders' meeting were called, with 10 days advance notice, with the main proposal being to waive the lock-up for Donald Trump. There is no way I see to amend the charter to get around the lock-up, without giving the market so much advance notice that you would totally tank the stock.

**Conclusion**

Again, not legal or investment advice, but my personal read is that¬†**the lock-up is much more ironclad than is currently being priced into the stock**.

I think once the shorts (who are getting killed daily on the borrow cost) recognize that no lock-up fuckery can happen for another 5.5 months (i.e. the main potential catalyst for an short-term price drop is¬†**not**¬†actually going to happen, and they are stuck with 5.5 months of borrow at $20/mo), they are going to run for the exits and this thing is going to absolutely moon.

**Position**

I have rolled some of my DJT gains last week into 4/12 calls of all varieties, which are currently dirt cheap since everyone thinks this stock is going nowhere fast.

Still turned out very well (gain porn attached), but could have been so much more.

I've been looking for another bite of the apple and I think I've found something based on a deep dive of the DJT SEC filings.

I am a securities lawyer who reads SEC filings for fun, so I feel obligated to say that¬†**this is in no way legal or investment advice**.

Everyone and their mom is either short or heavily into puts on this dogshit company. As we are all aware, they had $4 million of revenue in 2023. The company itself is worthless.

However, the borrow cost is outrageous. (see¬†https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240403272/why-shorting-trumps-djt-stock-could-cost-you-500). If the stock isn't actively dropping, shorts are getting killed by the borrow cost. I've read that¬†**it costs $20/share/month to borrow this POS**.

The company already released their (abysmal) full year 2023 earnings, and yet the stock is still hanging on - trading in the $40s when everyone knows the true worth based on the business outlook is like $0-1 per share. Clearly bad financial and operational news is irrelevant.

**If you are short you are losing $20/month on the borrow.**¬†Due to the borrow cost, I have to think that¬†**anyone who is currently short (or has April-May puts) is banking on a near term price drop trigger: Donald Trump unloading his shares.**

Now, if you did the first level of due diligence and read the individual lock-up agreements, filed with the SEC, you would notice that the company can basically waive the lock-up at will:

**Lock-Up Agreements**

Here is Donald Trump's actual individual lock-up agreement, filed with his 13D this past Monday:¬†[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/947033/000114036124017051/ef20025668\_ex99-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/947033/000114036124017051/ef20025668_ex99-2.htm)

* It says that he can't sell his shares, or pledge his shares for a loan (which many have incorrectly suggested he could do to monetize his stake).
* Waivers and amendments require the consent of the company, and of Eric Swider, as the Purchaser CEO Representative. See Section 2(g).
* Eric Swider is a Board member of DJT. So basically, if the Board (including Swider) agrees, the lock-up can be waived.

With it being so easy to waive the lock-up, I think the shorts have priced in that a lock-up waiver is coming, and likely sooner rather than later.

**HOWEVER**, and I don't see that really anyone has picked up on this:

**Lock-Up in the Company Charter**

There is ALSO a lock-up in the company's certificate of incorporation that applies to Donald Trump's shares. See Section 4.8 of the certificate of incorporation they just filed with their 10-K:¬†[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124016719/ef20025342\_ex3-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124016719/ef20025342_ex3-2.htm)

* Section 4.8 basically mirrors the lock-up provisions in the individual lock-up agreements - no stock sales, no stock pledges for loans, etc.
* Why is this supplemental lock-up in the certificate of incorporation (which is very unusual btw) a big deal if it just says what is already in the individual lock-up agreements?

**Here's why: A company's certificate of incorporation \*cannot be waived or amended by the Board\*. It can only be amended by a vote of the shareholders.**

* Even though Donald Trump owns >50% of the shares, Section 7.3 says that the shareholders cannot take action by written consent, so¬†**any amendment or waiver would have to be proposed and voted on at a formal special meeting of shareholders**.
* Under Delaware law, you have to give at least 10 days advance notice of a shareholders' meeting, and fully describe the meeting proposals to the shareholders.

You can imagine what would happen to the DJT stock price if a shareholders' meeting were called, with 10 days advance notice, with the main proposal being to waive the lock-up for Donald Trump. There is no way I see to amend the charter to get around the lock-up, without giving the market so much advance notice that you would totally tank the stock.

**Conclusion**

Again, not legal or investment advice, but my personal read is that¬†**the lock-up is much more ironclad than is currently being priced into the stock**.

I think once the shorts (who are getting killed daily on the borrow cost) recognize that no lock-up fuckery can happen for another 5.5 months (i.e. the main potential catalyst for an short-term price drop is¬†**not**¬†actually going to happen, and they are stuck with 5.5 months of borrow at $20/mo), they are going to run for the exits and this thing is going to absolutely moon.

Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,10,1bwof0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,6,1712339546.0,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?",2024-04-05 17:52:26,2024-04-05 17:52:26+00:00

That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,7792,1bwof0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,898,1712339546.0,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora.

If you read someone's ""DD"" and part of that ""DD"" is something related to dividend capture, how there's an upcoming dividend, etc., you immediately know this person is a complete fucking regard and has no idea what he's talking about, and you should probably evaluate the ""DD"" with that lens.

I've recently read some [moronic DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bslbdu/ges_covering_by_special_dividend_416/) on GES's upcoming special dividend and the amount of blind ignorance on even the most basic of corporate finance concepts demonstrated in the comments is just astonishing (and somehow, a week after the fact, I'm still getting DMs asking me the most basic of stock market 101 questions).

1. Stock prices automatically adjust downward for both regular and special dividends on the dividend ex-date.

2. Option strike prices will get adjusted for special dividends.

3. The company pays out the dividend to ALL holders when a dividend is issued. That means if you are short a stock at $25, if the company pays out a $5 dividend, you, as the short-seller pay the $5 to the person you borrowed the share from (NOT to the company, as the idiot OP in that post seems to think). The company earns NO profit from issuing a special dividend, and it is always a cash outflow for the company. The short pays $5 for the borrowed stock dividend, the stock price gets adjusted from $25 to $20, and you're net even. YOU TOOK MONEY OUT OF ONE POCKET AND PUT IT INTO THE OTHER.

Other caveats that you regards don't seem to understand:

1. Dividends are double-taxed, meaning the company paid taxes on that income, and then you are paying taxes on the dividend.

2. By issuing a dividend, the company is essentially saying ""this fucking clueless regard on WSB knows what to do with the cash better than we do. We will trust them to manage the cash for us.""

Do you really want to invest in a company who thinks the average fucking room-temperature IQ regard on this sub has better cash-deployment skills than the company's management? If they didn't pay out the dividend, it goes to retained earnings, which can be used to fund growth, make acquisitions, improve operations, etc. Instead, they are trusting fucking /u/suckonyourmomstits to make better use of the cash than they could themselves.

This isn't an anti-dividend post; dividend-paying companies **can** have their uses in specific portfolio construction cases, however, it seems that the vast majority of regards on this sub completely misunderstand how dividends actually work.",2024-04-05 18:35:02,2024-04-05 18:35:02+00:00

Sounds great to your average person until you realize that it ends with a handful of competing Megacorps, each in control of an advanced intelligence like Tony Stark's Jarvis and all willing do whatever it takes to keep their precious AI dominant.  That may be a stretch, but the following certainly isn't.

Consider the rise and fall of Blockbuster, helped along by the emergence of Netflix's disruptive first business model - DVDs mailed straight to the customer's doorstep for a fraction of the cost. In a decade, an American tradition - the act of jumping into the family van for a trip to pick out a new movie and grab your favorite candy had disappeared. Then, Netflix further evolved their business, going completely digital. Then they evolved again, announcing that they were going to invest several billions of dollars into producing their own original content. Many were quick to call the decision a gamble at the time but it's clearly paid off for the tech giant. So what's the next step for the streaming companies of the world, you ask?

The death of Hollywood as we know it.

Consider this, your great-grandchildren might not even watch the same films or play the same video games as their friends, simply because the size of available content will veer towards infinity. Much like it does now, your favorite streaming service (or its future-day equivalent), will present you with a list of titles you might enjoy watching, but they won't be real films - at least not films that any real person has made. And they'll all be curated to your pleasure. Try explaining the ""list of movies you might enjoy"" to your wife when she accidentally logs into your profile.

Imagine anyone of your favorite streaming services now has the ability to invest billions into Generative AI. Eventually, and sooner than you think, there is going to be an AI that can write a full-length movie script (or even an entire series), generate fake movie stars who appear indistinguishable from real actors as they appear on screen, and create compelling, heart-wretching scenes with lifelike reality - all within mere seconds. And the content will be available to billions of consumers on the fly. In not so many years from now, Mission Impossible 20 won't cost $300 million to produce and it's release date won't be impacted by delays caused by Covid-30. The newest, big action film will cost no more than the energy it takes for your thumb to hit the *Randomize* button. Billions, trillions, an infinite number of AI generated films will be available at your fingertips and watchable at any given moment. Video games too.

The Timotay Chamalays of the world today are going to be some of the last *real* stars our great-great grandchildren see. There will always be stars of course, but they won't be real.

So where does this leave you, the less than average investor? You know the remora, that little fish that attaches itself to sharks? That's your best hope, chum. The ""largest"" transfer of wealth that happened during covid is going to seem small in comparison to the upcoming transfer - the big one. The big one will be a result of exponential, AI-driven growth and it will usher in a new list of AI tycoons whose wealth and notoriety dwarf that of the old money families.

People laugh at how outlandish a $25 trillion dollar valuation is for Nvidia, but I do think we will see companies valued at ten, or even in the tens of trillions by the mid 2030s.

For a minute or two, imagine a future where the majority of jobs have been replaced by AI alternatives and profit margins are soaring. Then imagine a little further into the future, when even those jobs that were once the most physically degrading like surgeons, and those requiring intense concentration and skill like hookers, have also been replaced by robots, humanoid or other. How will you feed your family when there is a robutt that's made yours obsolete in comparison?

You'll hope that whichever Megacorp presides over your geographic region is generous with their distribution of resources, and pray that they feed you not because they are required by law to maintain a certain mortality rate, but rather, that AI's growth has been stewarded into a new utopian western civilization - one in which all can prosper.

ROOT is an online direct to consumer insurance company with all time highs at over $500. It is currently trading at $81 per share, which is up nearly 800% since its initial push in February. I am honestly shocked this stock has not gained much traction in this subreddit given the nature of it. 


As for DD, the company is still operating at a loss, but has been steadily increasing EPS quarter to quarter and is at a reasonable price compared to other companies in its niche sector, such as HIPO, which operates at a much higher deficit.

Implications of Google Buying HubSpot,5,1bwqki2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwqki2/implications_of_google_buying_hubspot/,5,1712344901.0," **What Happened:** The second the internet found out that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, was in talks to make a bid for the marketing software company Hubspot‚Ä¶

Well‚Ä¶ let's just say investors ran to purchase some shares.¬†

**Background:** HubSpot, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had a market cap of around $32 billion before the news was leaked by [Reuters](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/hubspot-stock-jumps-amid-reports-google-parent-alphabet-considering-acquisition/ar-BB1l5hUX). The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.

**Company Synergies:** Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies.¬†

**Potential Implications:** Alphabet must be careful as it has faced some major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.

* The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google‚Äôs ad business.
* The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.

To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer.¬†

Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it difficult to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.

**Bottom line:** If the acquisition were to go through, it would be the largest in Alphabets history and allow for its mega pile of cash to be put to use, currently at $110.9 billion as of the end of December

Ymab Therapeutics Just Initiated a New Trial Yesterday for Non Hodgkin Lymphoma,3,1bwr95t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwr95t/ymab_therapeutics_just_initiated_a_new_trial/,11,1712346622.0,"The link to the trial is below:

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05994157?cond=Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin&aggFilters=status:not&rank=2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05994157?cond=Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin&aggFilters=status:not&rank=2)

Planning for the trial started as early as August 2023. The trial plans to enroll approximately 30 people, but will enroll as few as 16 people based on the company's history. 

The drug they are proposing is a variant of Daratumumab, with delivery of the drug to the site of the tumor using special nano technology developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

One thing I noticed was that the exclusion criteria for the trial included '>40% lymphoma bone marrow involvement'. However, over 80% of small lymphocyte lymphoma cases involve bone marrow, especially with the younger age group (18-34 years) that the company will likely recruit from. 

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889858809000902](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889858809000902)

  
Of those 80%, more than half will have higher than 40% bone marrow involvement. Even though the 5-year survival period for the most aggressive cases of lymphoma is 60%, this trial will likely fail. This is because the exclusion criteria also mentions that a person cannot be on any maintenance treatment for at least 100 days prior to entering the trial. As a result, a person with recurrent, aggressive non Hodgkin's lymphoma without maintenance treatment will be poorly equipped to fight the disease. 

  
Ymab Therapeutics is running the bulk of it trials in Scottsdale Arizona, where numerous patients have reported their disease initially looking very similar to multiple myeloma, requiring multiple biopsies to confirm the correct disease. Multiple biopsies create the risk of a tumor spreading and becoming untreatable, even if the patient barely satisfies the trial's inclusion criteria. 

I believe that the trials will fail to demonstrate any meaningful improvement in the patient's condition despite the company's claim of the drug offering a low toxicity profile. 

  
If the company does not update its recruiting status by end of April, they are very likely not going to move forward with the trial based on initial results with treated patients.

UWMC vs HUNTERCROOK,1,1bwrczf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwrczf/uwmc_vs_huntercrook/,1,1712346881.0,"If people haven't seen the recent short attack against UWMC stock it is almost down right criminal. Not only are we dealing with a short hedge fund trying to manipulate the stock market. They are partnered with a fricken ""News Agency"" who gave them this information right before they published. 

Guess what happened next HUNTERBROOK opens up a 100 million dollar position into the UWMC short position and opened a long position into the rival RKT. Who could have seen that coming from the manipulating Hedge funds! 

Now 2 days later and we now have an even better development! Another short activist known as  **Fiat Lux Partners** has officially come after the first short hedge fund. We now have shorts vs shorts. Here is what Fiat states as there goal.  

### ""We, as seasoned short-sellers, understand the work that goes into constructing an honest and credible activist short report.But just as we understand the financial games that some companies play to give the appearance of strong performance, we also understand the tactics used by some short-sellers to manufacture an influential short case.We intend to publish responses to short reports which we believe to be flawed, in the interest of policing the activist space against low-quality reports and protecting the honest short-sellers whose collective credibility they threaten.""

### Here is what they discovered against Huntercrook https://x.com/FiatLuxPartners/status/1776291151340798222 

If this is allowed to go on we might have the future of short hedge funds creating news and trading off it while us retail traders are getting shafted. This is worst than when they went after WSB's for the game stop stuff. They were calling everyone who posts here pump and dumpers but here when the hedge funds do it they get no blow back.

I have a portfolio worth about 175k but I recently lost 15k in United Healthcare ($UNH) stock (this was my largest holding). Since I feel much behind peers in terms of earnings (I only make 65k while many of my friends in finance tech etc. make double or triple that and already have portfolios or houses worth 750k+), I have been trying to be very aggressive, putting most of my money in four or five stocks at a time. On Monday, I had 120k in $UNH. No options though just equities. 

 So far this year, it has worked fairly well as I have made about 25-30k which is half my salary in capital gains. However, after losing the 15k in UNH, I have been making even riskier moves to chase my losses. I lost another 5k after Monday‚Äôs 15k loss. Now I‚Äôm thinking about taking a market reset for 90 days and just leaving all of my money in a 5% money market. I want to make the money back to catch up to peers, but I am worried that I‚Äôll just end up losing more. Right now I really want to buy a UNH out for their earnings call but with my luck the stock will end up going up and I‚Äôll lose another 5k.

It‚Äôs even been affecting my personal life as I feel like I‚Äôm consumed by the 15k loss.

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. ",2024-04-05 21:03:15,2024-04-05 21:03:15+00:00

Even The Fed Is Confused About The Economic Data,4,1bwu6n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwu6n0/even_the_fed_is_confused_about_the_economic_data/,1,1712353729.0,"JPOW often plays the dummy card when he has to explain the economy particularly around the jobs and CPI reports.

Just like on WSB, there are some topics we just can‚Äôt touch even though it‚Äôs pretty obvious why the jobs report came in smashing estimates.

And for that reason alone, the market responded positively since everyone took out their calculators and backed out one statistic to arrive at the true jobs report out. So all good right?

One other thing to consider over the weekend is the alarm bell the United Way is sounding in regards to poverty lines that haven‚Äôt moved much since 2010. This population is called ALICE and increased 18% from 2010 to 36 million people in 2021. They haven‚Äôt reported an update since, which is huge red flag. So you know those numbers are now jacked to the tits.

This is a data set that predicted the subprime mortgage crisis, baby formula shortage and now they are saying there is a big fucking problem. 

So the debate is whether or not that actually matters for the stock market.

Even though it sucks ass, I still think we ride. The biggest returns are missed when you sit on the sidelines with a dick in your hand trying to time bottoms. 

Someone once said shut the fuck up about the economy it has nothing to do with the fucking stock market you fucking idiot. 

That someone was my dad on Saturday because he had to work the weekend again at Dave and Busters.",2024-04-05 21:48:49,2024-04-05 21:48:49+00:00

What will be the final straw that causes you to sell the stock? The fundamentals of the company are degrading, yet the stock price isn't really going down that much. This means that people aren't really selling. The stock trades at a forward PE of about 60, probably higher if current estimates are too high, which they likely are. The growth of the company is stalling and the company is desperately trying to drop prices and do all sorts of other things to sell cars. Elon is a loose canon and while in the past that was a good thing, it now seems like more of a liability than at anything. The stock trades at a rich valuation because people expect a bright future ahead, but what will cause you to change your mind about Tesla's future and sell the stock? Elon has promised quite a lot and you probably believe him, but he has a bad record of overpromising, so what, if anything, will cause you stop believing in what he says?

A fellow regard posted his DD on the company a year ago, and he was right on the money. I'm here to tell you that even after this insane run up, its still not too late to get on this ride.

Despite bearish sentiment since their recent earnings, the stock's performance is backed up with improving fundamentals. If the business improves, its stock price will improve. It's strange to see cases where it doesn't happen over time.

I'll go through most of the important information from their financial statements:

**Revenue TTM:** from 3.7b to 4.28b

**ROA TTM:** from 0.1 to 11.54

**ROIC TTM:** from 0.16 to 18.18

**ROE TTM:** from 0.37 to 37.93

**Gross Margin TTM:** from 52.97 to 59.67

**Operating Margin TTM:** from 2.44 to 11.23

**Net Margin TTM:** from 0.08 to 7.67

**Debt to Equity ratio TTM:** from 1.76 to 1.01

**Total assets:** from 2.71b to 2.94b

**Total liabilities:** from 2.01b to 1.92b

**Total debt:** from 1.22b to 1.05

**Net debt:** from 706.59m to 147.48m

The only thing that was somewhat negative was that EPS was beaten only by 5%, the smallest out of the last 4 quarters.

I think its also important to mention a crucial element of this stock and that is the reduction of 30% of their float. Over the course of the last 6 years, the float was reduced from 65m outstanding to 49m outstanding, yet the price movement didn't respond accordingly. Only once the business made a turnaround, the price finally started it's ascend. In fact, the float was increased in the current year from 49m to 51m.

Almost every single aspect of the company and financial health improved in the recent quarter, yet the market decided that because the EPS was beaten by just 5%, it means its the end of world.

Will we see the same returns over the coming year? probably not

But I think this is a case of the ""stock is up this much, its can't possibly go any higher"" fallacy

I'm long on this position, but im guessing around 50-60% upside in the near future

That's is all for now fellow regards!

Since then, the weeklies have expired worthless, but luckily they were small part of the account. 

I have since added more (added 5x136c for 4/19) and took some profit (sold 3 of those with ~$300 profit each ) when it went up.

Somehow I still have  17 various calls. Yesterday morning, I was actually in profit (started account with 40k, almost hit 41k), but sitting at 36.2k end of day today. 

What do you guys think ? If it ramps up next week, should I trim at least half ? The close was super strong today, I do reasonably expect it to run next week especially with the monthly earning report mid week. 

If they are able to come out and confidently say estimates are not impacted by the earthquake, does it mean they are already way ahead of schedule ? If I were behind schedule for growth, I wouldn't have passed on blaming the earthquake, instead of coming out and dismissing the entire event as a no impact",2024-04-05 23:32:42,2024-04-05 23:32:42+00:00
