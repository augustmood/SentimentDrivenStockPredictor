What do we thinking about TSLA earnings? ,5,1bwxsed,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwxsed/what_do_we_thinking_about_tsla_earnings/,17,1712362914.0,"I'm kind of new to options but I was taking a look at TSLA and saw that their earnings are coming up. For the past 6 earnings reports, in 5/6 they've dropped an average of 9.52% the next day. 

While I'm not saying it's guaranteed they'll drop, they've been doing terrible this last year and even if they manage to hit EPS estimates I really doubt that the stock still won't tank. Thoughts?

I'm waiting until the day before earnings to buy positions but I'm most likely going to be buying puts for 5/26 at a strike price of around 10% down from their price on that day. ",2024-04-06 00:21:54,2024-04-06 00:21:54+00:00

I'm re-writing my position because reddit doesn't allow me to edit posts on the phone app with images.

I've done a bit more research. My postion:

6800 warrants at a ratio of 0,05. This represents 340 stocks, or 3.4 regular call options.
Strike price at 190$.
Expiration date: 20 June 2025.

RH and BLK and coming earnings and why I shorted RH ?! What about BLK?,10,1bwzo8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwzo8y/rh_and_blk_and_coming_earnings_and_why_i_shorted/,26,1712368346.0,"Let's see if I can summarize this here. I have been short on RH for some time now. Before making my conclusions, I examined the following data. First off, I want to say that my research led me to believe that the product's quality is not that great. I live in NYC, and RH has an outlet here in Industry City, which is in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their prices are overextended, which I attribute to RH's thorough research. They know that the average household income of families residing in the surrounding areas exceeds $250k per year. I am pretty sure their outlets are in similar locations for the exact same reason: it's a simple profit/loss ratio, and RH knows that the higher profit margin will offset the higher average carrying expenses. So, why would I short the stock and bet against RH? My first reason was the low home sales. Interest rates have risen quite a bit; a 30-year fixed rate is above 7%, and most homebuyers would try to maximize their savings by purchasing furniture from one of RH's competitors. RH supposedly manufactures their furniture pieces in China. Full disclosure, I have no idea where exactly it is made, but a simple Google search will tell you that. Follow this link for more information: \[link to furniture manufacturing details\].

Have consumers been complaining about the product or the quality of the product? You can read the reviews for yourself here: \[link to consumer reviews\].

Now, my reasoning was that since home sales have been down, and the quality of the furniture is not pleasing to the average consumer, and in general, people are not furnishing their new houses, RH would likely miss their analysts' earnings call and underperform. Well, this is exactly what happened. The adjusted net revenue of $738 million missed the consensus mark of $777 million by 5% and fell by 4.4% on a year-over-year basis. The revenue decline was attributed to ""several weather"" events in January and shipping delays related to the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea. RH missed Q4 earnings and revenue estimates. RH reported quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, missing the estimated earnings of $1.71 per share.

Logically, one would expect that the price per share of the stock would drop accordingly to account for the revenue loss. However, we witnessed the opposite; the price per share went up by almost 18% after the earnings announcement.

Let's not forget that the short interest before the earnings call was more than 51%.

According to the data and common sense consensus, everyone should have expected that since RH did not meet expectations, the price per share would come down to adjust the value based on performance. This did not happen. On the contrary, the price went up, and shorts got squeezed.

Could this be manipulation? No way, this is a fair commodity, a self-regulated market, and manipulations are not possible.

Now, let's talk about the biggest institutional investors behind RH. It turns out that the largest shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.

I am trying to find any correlation between the price movement of RH's stock and BLK's, but my indicators are not refined enough to discover the precise connection, and I would leave this to the readers.

Anyway, why am I talking about RH and a potential connection with market movement and the price of BLK's stock? Well, BLK is set to announce earnings this coming Friday, April 12th.

So, some scenarios could possibly aid the retail investor's decision. How overstretched are the big funds, and could they go down because their investment assets have come down in price? Let's not forget LULU... What are your bets? Are you playing calls or puts on BLK?

First Spy Spread and Scare,2,1bx0xtj,https://i.redd.it/9u1o3wxgxrsc1.jpeg,10,1712372120.0,"I attempted my first bull call spread instead of simply buying puts/calls like a proper wallstreeter would. I always expire on fridays and last week was good friday which I forgot was a federal holiday and the stock market would be closed. So I went in friday morning to close out my spread incase of any last minute exercises that could happen if you leave them open. Only to find out my call was exercised. I see -50k in my account and immediately freak out because my account that I am using only has 20k in it. After farther research I realized that it was only the call that I bought that got exercised because it was deep in the money so Fidelity automatically exercises for you to receive your gains, which I did not think they would do if I didn't have the money to fully cover. I then sold first thing monday before the dip as well and ended up with $350 in gains from the call. I went from terrified to excited that Fidelity would front me the money temporarily to allow me to realize my gains which makes me even happier that I switched from Robinhood to Fidelity a while ago.

The ETF bubble we hope to never pop. ,1,1bx0xwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bx0xwl/the_etf_bubble_we_hope_to_never_pop/,1,1712372127.0,"Hello my sweet baby rays, 


I am here to present an idea, not wholly my own but probably a Socratic seminar too long for you TikTok riddled Americans, but I‚Äôll proceed.   


First and foremost this is not advice of any kind, let alone financial, Jesus. 

Ok seriously we‚Äôve weeded out the normies and you my sweet reader are still with me and my lack of prescriptions today. The next bubble I hope to never see pop, leak, or even fart are ETFs.  

A few facts on ETFs:
 1. They can sell unlimited shares. Of course this is how they make money to operate: you buy into an etf, they take your shares and buy what they told they hold in. Simply put, it‚Äôs a cool vehicle for passive investing. See point 2 now. They supposedly have solid internal control here   A cute concept.     

2. ETF reports the NAV price at the END OF THE DAY.  think about that for a second. One time of day, they report the NAV back to the ETF holders who check on their retirement.   Just once, end of day.  You check your onlyfans more than that.  


Thesis in soft brain form from here: 

America is passively investing into the idiot sharks of wall street and asking for a daily update on price‚Ä¶..leaving room for = wallstreet arbitrage.  

America passively invests billions into a greed den filled with MIT and Harvard geniuses.  Who can day trade all day long and then sell back at NAV to the ETF and America is like ‚Äúyummy daddy thank you for playing with my retirement all day and then telling me my sweet daily NAV.‚Äù   


Because I am stoned, here is chat telling you how this works: 

Traders could potentially exploit price discrepancies between the ETF's market price and its net asset value (NAV) by engaging in arbitrage activities. This could involve buying or selling shares of the ETF and simultaneously trading the underlying securities to capture the price difference. While this activity is a fundamental part of ETF trading and helps keep the ETF's market price closely aligned with its NAV, there are regulations and mechanisms in place to prevent unjust enrichment or manipulation. Regulatory bodies monitor ETF trading activities to ensure fairness and integrity in the market. Additionally, ETF issuers and authorized participants play roles in maintaining efficient arbitrage mechanisms to minimize price disparities. However, like any financial market, there is always a potential for abuse or manipulation, which regulatory oversight aims to mitigate.


Conclusions if any matter: 

1. This could well just be a fact of life that is not a giant issue.  Except it is cute that Americans had an idea that you could passively invest.  Boomers are so cute.  
2. Is this why America sucks? We sucked the finance dick for decades into a glut and we forgot to make new airports and shit?
3. I am just saying there is room fjor fraud.   
4.  Passive money is dumb and I think we can make money trading with it.  
5.  Please evicerate the idea or add on it.

Why is that? is it because the globalists continue to repeat ad nauseum that water is not a human right? ya maybe.

&#x200B;

Or is it because water is only part of what ECL does? did you know that they also immunize farm aminals against deadly diseases? I did mention it my last DD, but by that time I was so burnt out I couldn't continue on expanding how that will be immensely beneficial.

&#x200B;

I was dreading writing a DD about the latest developments of avian flu, but luckily, news articles are doing it for me.

It's Covid 2: ""Birdemic"", and the Americas favorite most trusted news outlet is not overexaggerating at all in the slightest when they say:

&#x200B;

A bird flu has been going on for longer than you think; believe it or not. Since my first ECL post actually. The CDC has already locked down the number of birds per square foot and all regulations that have been put in place are already here. What I am basically saying is that if you want to yolo on egg futures, it won't work out. Now... How does $ECL play into all this? well, as I said previously (read section 6 (it's quick) and come back), they immunize farm aminals.

But, just like ""Nalco"" is handling the water side, ""CID Lines"" is handling the livestock side.

Can Donald Trump sell Covered Calls on DJT?,112,1bx5cx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bx5cx7/can_donald_trump_sell_covered_calls_on_djt/,123,1712387202.0,"Since he has 80 million shares that he can't sell for 6 months. Can he sell covered calls at October and later on DJT. He sells 22.5 calls at $12-18 each, If he could sell enough of them, he could cash out 1 Billion now, and if the stock is still worth $20, in six months he cashes out another 1.6 billion.

If a broker is worried about early assignment because of a huge price increase, he could hedge with buying $115 calls at $1.

Looks like they hint at the broker work around here:  
 ""Trump cannot sell his stock in the company for six months, making it difficult to translate Truth Social's value into liquid cash that can be spent on the campaign,"" Europa Group analysts said in a report. ""That outlook could change over the coming months, particularly if Trump obtains the waiver or can find a lender willing to accept shares in Trump Media as collateral.""

Best ways to give yourself odds,4,1bxbvb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxbvb0/best_ways_to_give_yourself_odds/,3,1712410919.0,"It's very common for people to call day traders ""gamblers"", to conflate the world of trading FDs and small caps with the world of slot machines and rigged table games. 

It only reinforces this view when a trader treats the market like a casino. For instance, the odds of winning any given hand of blackjack are approximately 49% at most casinos (depending on the rules, how many decks of cards, or whether you can speak an exotic foreign language to the dealer). 

So, if walking into a casino with the goal of making a bet with your money and walk out richer a gambler wants to make a single bet,  place all the money they brought to gamble with them on one hand BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE LESS THAN 50%. 

The stock market game can be different. There are simple systems of trading and various setups in technicals that can give the trader an edge GREATER THAN 50%, therefore a successful trader will play to stay in the game and make as many bets on setups that give them the odds as possible. So, instead of opening Robinhood and posting all of one's money on a single bet, it makes more sense to  let one's self budget for the expense of losing trades. Say they're 7 wins for 3 losses on average (arbitrary), then on one's balance they could say they'll risk no more than 5% on any given trade (again, arbitrary and erring towards aggression because we tend to try to get rich quick here). 

For instance, I've noticed if the market opens at support or resistance it will usually be really good odds to buy a call or put for the corresponding scenario, especially because the opening tends to come with a burst of volume and momentum, which can give strong odds for profits on 0dtes >50% within minutes. 

Sometimes the market doesn't open at support or resistance. What then? Well, the pre-market often can give a trader a few clues on what levels the market may gravitate towards that day. So say the market opens and it does its thing, usually a little tug-a-war, then one side gains the upper hand and there's a burst in price in either direction. A trader can often hop into this momentum and target a pre-market high or low. 

What about when a stock reaches its resistance or support? Should a trader immediately reverse course and but a put or call? Not necessarily. Most often there is a battle at these levels that can result in a stock trading sideways for awhile. It would grind away theta on 0dtes and weeklies quickly, and even worse, totally smash their value if the price were to break out and run again the trade. So it's best to wait for something that gives odds like a decisive move past the level (usually including a retest of the level then a move back above the prior breaking move), or a double bottom/top (preferably with false break suggesting a large player seeking liquidity at levels with lots of open orders).

Of course none of the three aforementioned strategies have a 100% success rate. Market bots are designed to beat retail traders by tricking them and playing on their emotional tendencies. They're very good at it. So a successful trader has to be nimble minded and prepared for anything. 

Just a few thoughts and some of my favorite setups. If you disagree and believe it's best to throw down every bit of money you can access on a single play, I find nothing particularly wrong with that. I find it ballsy and entertaining. 

Trading in a systemic and analytic manner is much tougher to execute and few people actually succeed. Those who do usually lose a lot of money before gaining the skillset required to be consistent. I still have a lot of improving to do personally but I do believe I can do it because some other people can and I've had several month long streaks of success. 

It's just a matter of a single day or two where I become emotional after a loss that balloons to the size of Texas (relative to my account) that has kept me from being able to quit my job. I've adopted a strategy of withdrawing gains from my cash account and keeping the balance only large enough to make decent income, but small enough that I likely won't get emotional about it and that any horrible day won't have me begging on a street corner.

I found the event program info page and found that there was a man there named Satoshi Hada and Toshiaki Tanaka 

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/646763.706338

We can finally pinpoint that there was a Satoshi in the same building with Hal Finney at a Crypto event in 1998. 

I then Googled ""Satoshi Hada Naka Moto"" I found one tweet who also pieced this together with no replies at the time. 

He also put the names of the research papers together  

https://twitter.com/H_D_BE_2002/status/1742628299489137069

He linked a research paper with the following names on it talking about public and private keys (you have to view it in archive.org) 

https://researcher.draco.res.ibm.com/researcher/view_person_subpage.php?id=899

Satoshi: SATOSHI Hada 
Naka: Toshiaki TaNAKA 
Moto: Naohiko UraMOTO 

Now put all 3 names together - Satoshi Naka Moto 

I then started researching the names and things like projects and timelines all check out. It is funny that while all these names talk about public, private keys, blockchain and crypto, NONE talk about Bitcoin.

I then googled ""satoshi hada"" Cypherpunk to see if he was part of that and an email surfaced here from December 2001. 

https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xenc-xmlp-tf/2001Dec/0001.html

I then went to Satoshi Hada's twitter here  

    https://twitter.com/satoshihada

His tweet from 2017 caught my eye, someone made a comment in backwards text in 2021 saying Satoshin Nakamoto almost 3 years to the day of my discovery It looks possible that Satoshi Nakamoto is a combination of at least 3 people that were IBM researchers involved in early blockchain research work that predates bitcoin. 

OR it can be another person or group that admired their work and took a piece of each of their names. I believe Hal Finney was not Satoshi Nakamoto and he also did not know him personally based on interviews with Fran Finney. I believe he was on that mailing list that when the white paper went out, saw it and got involved. I also feel these 3 men worked on it and moved on to other things with their lives and kept it a secret!

She continued: ""Most analysts have Tesla classified as an auto company. It isn't. It isn't at all. It's a robot, energy storage, AI company, and its margins will show through.""

""The auto industry -- Ford and GM -- is backing away from EVs. That's a big mistake because the only way they'll become profitable is to scale [EVs.] So they're basically ceding the market to Tesla and they will have obsolete products as Tesla's cars drop into the $20,000 to $25,000 range within five years, compared with their average of $30,000 to $45,000.""

The Phallic Formation Indicator (PFI) is a groundbreaking technical  analysis tool that has revolutionized the way institutions interpret  market sentiment and price movements. By transforming traditional  candlestick patterns into distinctive phallic shapes, the PFI provides a  unique and intuitive visual representation of bullish and bearish  trends, offering unparalleled insights into market dynamics.

The core principle of the PFI is its ability to identify and categorize  market conditions into two primary formations: the 'Bullish Shaft' and  the 'Bearish Shaft.' The Bullish Shaft formation signifies strong upward  momentum and investor confidence, typically indicating a potential  buying opportunity. Conversely, the Bearish Shaft formation signals  downward pressure and growing investor pessimism, suggesting a possible  selling or shorting opportunity.

Institutions employing the PFI in their analysis benefit from its  simplicity and effectiveness. The clear and unmistakable shapes allow  for rapid assessment of market conditions, enabling traders and analysts  to make swift and informed decisions. Moreover, the PFI integrates  seamlessly with other technical indicators and analysis techniques,  enhancing its reliability and predictive power.

The Phallic Formation Indicator has gained widespread adoption among  hedge funds, investment banks, and asset management firms, who value its  innovative approach to market analysis. Its ability to cut through  market noise and provide clear, actionable signals has made it an  indispensable tool in the arsenal of institutional traders and analysts  worldwide.

Rate cuts or no?,203,1bxhm99,https://i.redd.it/8ft0g527dwsc1.jpeg,214,1712425836.0,"

 While everyone is waiting for FED to cut rates, I'm seeing it otherwise. Forget cuts, we might be looking at rate hikes later this year. Rising commodity prices are going to bring back scorching inflation. 

  
**Common myth:** Interest rates control commodity prices  

**Reality**: Commodity prices govern interest rates. Central banks are just data observers and just follow what the commodity prices and hence inflation tells them. What if the inflation still keeps rising? They just follow.

And I understand that consumer demand is low.

JPOW Says He‚Äôs Confused About The Economy ,407,1bxift1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxift1/jpow_says_hes_confused_about_the_economy/,175,1712427887.0,"JPOW often plays the dummy card when he has to explain the economy particularly around the jobs and CPI reports.

Just like on WSB, there are some topics we just can‚Äôt touch even though it‚Äôs pretty obvious why the jobs report came in smashing estimates.

And for that reason alone, the market responded positively since everyone took out their calculators and backed out one statistic to arrive at the true jobs report out. 

One other thing to consider over the weekend is the alarm bell the United Way is sounding in regards to poverty lines that haven‚Äôt moved much since 2010. This population is called ALICE and increased 18% from 2010 to 36 million people in 2021. They haven‚Äôt reported an update since, which is huge red flag. So you know those numbers are now jacked to the tits.

This is a data set that predicted the subprime mortgage crisis, baby formula shortage and now they are saying there is a big fucking problem. 

So the debate is whether or not that actually matters for the stock market.

Even though it sucks ass, I still think we ride. The biggest returns are missed when you sit on the sidelines with somebody else‚Äôs shlong in your hand trying to time bottoms. 

Plus if you aren‚Äôt bullish on the solar eclipse you can fuck off right back to your shitty planet Nibiru. If you need gold hit up Peter Schiff. 

We don‚Äôt care about that anymore. In 10 years we will be eating your galaxy for lunch with Nvidia chips and a chocolate frosty. ",2024-04-06 18:24:47,2024-04-06 18:24:47+00:00

Plays for The Holy Trinity Next Week,107,1bxjsoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxjsoc/plays_for_the_holy_trinity_next_week/,67,1712431350.0,"Next week Wednesday and Thursday will be, without a doubt, one of the most volatile days of the year with Inflation YoY, CPI, and FOMC minutes all releasing next Wednesday. Not only that, we have initial jobless claims and PPI MoM releasing the next day. 

Clearly, there‚Äôs no synchronicity within the fed as you have some saying they‚Äôre on the right path and others saying the opposite. What these people say has a huge impact on the market as seen last week and next week could see some serious damage. 

My guess is they‚Äôre going to come to a conclusion they‚Äôre only going to do 1 cut sometime this year, maybe 2 if we‚Äôre lucky. 10 year yield is at 4.4% and inflation is still creeping up. The market is in serious need for a correction and they know they should rip the band-aid off now before election season. 

I‚Äôll most likely buy $7.5 UVXY 4/19 calls on Monday or Tuesday depending on what happens Monday. If positive news comes out next Wednesday, best believe I‚Äôll be buying SPY calls. SPY has literally been trading sideways for almost 2 months now and market confidence is uncertain at this point. Next week will make or break the bull market.

Bought a bunch of 0 DTE Tesla puts right before the Reuters hit piece on Tesla,481,1bxmfk0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bxmfk0,116,1712438023.0,"You may be wondering how the hell I lost money on the play of a lifetime. I bought 100 167.5P when the contracts were going for .35, costing a total of 3.5k for the position. These contracts were trading for 7.00 only one hour after I entered, meaning my 3.5k position was worth 70k. This 20 bagger will haunt me.

The strategy was simple and regarded: Tesla had 3 green daily candles in a row leading up to Friday- which if you‚Äôve been following Tesla‚Äôs dog water performance lately- is a huge anomaly so I figured Friday is leaning towards a red day. So I entered the 167.5Puts when Tesla was barely up trading at 169.10 and planned to sell when tesla reached 164ish for an easy 10 bagger from 3.5k to 
35k.

4/10 Will be a good day for $TSM,270,1bxpfb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxpfb6/410_will_be_a_good_day_for_tsm/,169,1712445860.0,"**EDIT: added a graph for those of you who don't know how to read**

Did a little DD on $TSM since they report revenue monthly (4/10) and earnings is coming up and figured I'd share with you lovely apes.

Based on [$TSM's historical revenue data](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024) along with the little bit of analysis I did (see below), I reckon April will be a beast of a month for $TSM.

Historically, March is the best month every year for TSMC in terms of % improvement from the previous month with 15% improvement on average over the last 18 years worth of data (over the last 4 years only, March is tied with August for the best MoM % improvement). February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.

You can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's & early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.

I am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.

Should CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.

Historically, March is the best month every year for TSMC in terms of % improvement from the previous month with 15% improvement on average over the last 18 years worth of data (over the last 4 years only, March is tied with August for the best MoM % improvement). February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.

You can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's & early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.

I am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.

Should CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.

Insurance Companies Are Dumping Customers In Droves And That‚Äôs Bullish,203,1bxpfgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxpfgj/insurance_companies_are_dumping_customers_in/,177,1712445872.0,"The big insurance companies just dropped their rebuttal to everyone that cashed in on new roofs over the last few years due to weather claims, which caused them significant losses. 

The Allstate CEO said if your roof is 20 years old and one hailstorm is going to take it off, you should pay fucking more than somebody with a brand new fucking roof. I added the fuckings. 

This was only after they flew military grade drones to every property in the US to take high quality images that would be run through computer models to flag risk and begin sending non renewal notices to over 100,000 customers.

Those that are lucky enough to stay will have their premiums jacked to high heaven unless you want to negotiate against an AI computer model that‚Äôs already repriced every property insurance contract on the planet perfectly like a flip of a light switch once it was fed the full serving of satellite imagery.

This is bullish as fuck for insurance companies. 

Like I know you guys are still mad about the losses, but was checkmate as a response completely necessary?",2024-04-06 23:24:32,2024-04-06 23:24:32+00:00
