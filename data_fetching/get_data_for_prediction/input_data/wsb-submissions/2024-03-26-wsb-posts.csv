# Donald Trump to own nearly 80 million 'DJT' shares

By [Tomi Kilgore](https://www.marketwatch.com/author/tomi-kilgore)

After Digital World Acquisition Corp.'s merger with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. closes, former President Donald Trump is expected to own 78,750,000 shares of the combined company.

That would represent 69.4% of the outstanding shares, assuming maximum redemptions by DWAC shareholders, [according to the latest S-4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312524036093/d408563ds4a.htm#rom408563_33) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Trump would be by far the largest shareholder. Why not, the company's stock ticker post-merger will be his initials, ""DJT.""

ARC Global Investments, which is the investment vehicle of former Chief Executive Patrick Orlando. is expected to be the second-largest shareholder, with 10,790,415 shares, or 9.3% of the shares outstanding.

Current CEO of Trump Media, Devin Nunes, would own 115,000 shares, or less than 1%.

Donald Trump Jr., who is expected to be a director of the company post-merger, isn't listed as expected to own any shares after the deal closes.

Some may argue that the insurers will pay out. That may be true, but short term sentiment is very negative and it will take a while for insurers to maybe pay out. I also think this news story will continue for c.1 week so the price should continue to damp.

Zoetis: The next moonshot,176,1bo4s3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bo4s3s/zoetis_the_next_moonshot/,81,1711449788.0,"Are you tired of missing out on gains from stocks that have already pumped? Well here’s your chance to actually get into something early for once, and maybe even save some animals doing it.

Dairy cattle in Texas have been getting sick for several weeks, and the USDA released a statement yesterday stating that the cause is a strain of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza:

https://www.nmpf.org/joint-dairy-organization-statement-on-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-cows/

HPAI has had devastating effects in the poultry industry the past couple years. Remember when your $1 eggs went to $5? Zoetis has a vaccine for HPAI in chickens, but due to the short lifespan of a chicken and the cost involved with vaccinating 1,000,000 birds in some barns, it was more cost effective to cross your fingers, hope they didn't catch it, and if they did, you did a slightly more sophisticated version of what NVDA put holders did - close the garage doors and keep the engine running.

Now this isn’t so simple or cost effective with a herd of dairy cattle. Those infected already will likely be culled and find their way into your local Wendys patty, so to limit further infection, there will be a rush to vaccinate uninfected cattle. Now are they going to put the cost of vaccination and the cost of mass producing it on our poor dairy farmers and pharmaceutical companies? Absolutely not. In comes the US government to the rescue paying 10x a shot to encourage drug companies to ramp up production and to convince a bunch of farmers who have been triggered by the word ""vaccine"" for 4 years to actually use it.

But the link says the disease is only in Texas and Kansas you may say. Wait a couple weeks. A lot of dairy heifers are raised in those states due to their favorable weather compared to WI, NY, and other large northern dairy states, so a lot of those heifers are catching it down there and getting shipped to their home herds daily. Idaho closed their borders to cattle last week, but they are the only state to do so thus far.

Why Zoetis? I work in the dairy industry and have known about this for a couple weeks, so when I saw a tweet from the Nancy Pelosi Stock Tracker that Rep. Shelley Moore bought $50k of Zoetis stock on 3/15, I chose them as my horse in this race. Moore is a ranking member of the Environmental & Public Works Committee. Merck is also rumored to have a vaccine, but ZTS has 1/4 of their market cap where this could have more effect and thus give us more tendies. For the icing on the cake, the IV is pitifully low for a company with this kind of market cap. So the gains potential is nice.

AMAT's 3 segments include **Semiconductor Systems** (74%), **Applied Global Services** (22%), & **Display &** **Adjacent Markets** (3%).  The Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment market estimated to grow \~10% CAGR over next 5 years. Among top 6 holdings (weight) of **SOXX ETF**. Outperformed **PHLX Index**.​

**Financials** ​

Beat EPS/Revenue Estimates all 4 quarters of 2023. Lowest CCC among direct competitors (183). FCF: 7.7B, much higher than direct competitors (LRCX 2nd at 4.86B). R&D expense $3.1B 2023. Last split 02'.​

**Competition** ​

AMAT competes in the Semiconductor industry with direct competition in the subindustry of **Semiconductor Equipment & Materials**. Major competitors include **Lam Research** (LRCX), **ASML** **Holdings** (ASML), & **KLA Corporation** (KLAC). All (& Nvidia) are also customers of AMAT. Large portfolio of offerings; 57.7k patents globally, 26k active patents; much more than competitors (& Nvidia).​

**Innovation/R&D** ​

Jan 9. 24'. AMAT announced collaboration with **Google** for advanced technologies for use in augmented reality. Dec 12. 23'. Announced partnership with **Ushio Inc.**, bringing to market the first Digital Lithography System Allowing **highest density** patterning & efficient patterning of glass & organic materials. FCF & R&D higher than competitors allows effective innovation. 2023 **EUV Pattern** **Shaping** technology improving Efficiency, Cost, & Effectiveness.​

**Threats**

Higher customer & geographical concentration; **TSMC** (19%), **Samsung** (15%), **China** (27%). Minor impact on revenue due to US export regulations on China. Various risks include global operations, rapidly changing industry, & changing customer preference. Legal compliance; 2023 **DOJ probe**, alleged bypassing US export regulations by channeling products through South Korea to China. ​

EDIT: Current price $210. To add a conclusion, i think with the current AI boom that AMAT has not seen the same kind of price appreciation as other companies and as being one of the few quote ""pick and shovel"" company of the semiconductor industry i think that AMAt could easily see a price appreciation to $250-$300 in the next 6-12 months. especially considering their product pipeline. as with other semiconductor companies i think they are one big announcement or earnings report away from a boom in their stock price.

Increased position in $FIVE (Five Below),10,1bo8esn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bo8esn/increased_position_in_five_five_below/,17,1711461086.0,"I’ve further grown my position in Five Below ($FIVE) as I believe this company is under valued significantly.

The thesis:

Five Below got beat up after a small miss on earning, but historically has printed every quarter. If you look at the chart, they are cyclical around their retail quarterly cycles. 

I can’t understate how much kids and tweens and teens love Five Below. They make buckets of money EPS wise, but have had troubles with shrink (theft).

They stated they are the latest in retails to stop/limit self checkouts, so I suspect highly this will get turned around.

TLDR, I think the algo's punished them for a 10 cent EPS miss, but I think they got it wrong.

Estimated EPS was 3.78, actual was 3.65. Still a very good result, but an ever so slight miss, and I think the algo's just automatically punished them for it. If you look at historical EPS performance, they are just about on target every single quarter going back to Q2 FY22.

Past that, if you look at their historical performance over the last year, you can see the clear ebbs and flows from their quarterly performance, which makes options a fun play; however, you can see after their downturns, within a month or so they rise back up after getting beaten down. Obviously past performance isn't a direct predictor, but its a nice sign.

Small wildcard, short interest:

They have ~55M shares outstanding. That hasn't changed much over the past few years

https://ycharts.com/companies/FIVE/shares_outstanding

currently ~4.5M-5M are sold short, which has been very persistent.

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/five/short-interest

if you look at other cyclical dips in the stock, you can see in the nasdaq link above that the shorts still didn't cover. Current days to cover based on average volume is 10 days. I don't think we're in squeeze territory, but that is a wild card.

As always, not financial advice.

THANK YOU DJT DWAC,16,1bo9cl5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bo9cl5,6,1711463513.0,"not a crazy gain but still a ~5k gain and meets the minimum threshold for a gain post so here you go:

The DJT DWAC trade saved my account and put me back in. Took big losses a couple weeks ago from:

a) buying SMCI puts the friday right before their entry into the S&P was announced

b) being up on NVDA calls 1/2 weeks ago and not taking profits and having them slowly sucked away as NVDA went sideways / fell through the beginning of GTC conference

Made it back and hope to never go back down to 5k in my account. Let’s see how this plays out but waiting for another opportunity like this and buying in. Didn’t buy into DWAC at first because was skeptical… then thought that it was too late.. then said fuck it need to risk some to make some so yesteday right before close bought 3 contracts and here we are. 

also: peep the puts and SNOW call (RIP) i have at the bottom. not pictured: -2k on TSM calls which i’ll be holding through earnings and close to the 4/19 date hoping for some sort of reversal",2024-03-26 14:31:53,2024-03-26 14:31:53+00:00

Insulin stocks - Why they will spike following Mcdonalds - Krispy kreme collab,707,1boarvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1boarvh/insulin_stocks_why_they_will_spike_following/,149,1711467164.0," Alright, listen up, fellow degenerates, 'cause I've got a juicy play for you. You've heard about McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme teaming up to flood America with doughnuts, right? Well, buckle up, 'cause we're about to cash in on the aftermath.

**Why We're Loading Up on Insulin Stocks:**

1. **MCD-Krispy Collab:** McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme are joining forces to sling doughnuts at every corner. More sugar bombs = more cases of diabetes and obesity meaning more people buying insulin.
2. **Enter Insulin Titans:** Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi are the big dogs in the insulin game. They're the ones keeping diabetics alive and kicking.
3. **Endless Demand:** With the obesity and diabetes epidemic on the rise, the demand for insulin is only going up, up, up.
4. **Global Reach:** These companies aren't just chilling in the US. They're global players, tapping into markets worldwide where diabetes is a growing concern (like half the west are obese).

**Why These Stocks Are Our Golden Ticket:**

* **Eli Lilly (LLY):** This bad boy has been in the diabetes game for ages. With their insulin products flying off the shelves, we're looking at a steady stream of tendies.
* **Novo Nordisk (NVO):** The OG of insulin. They've been keeping diabetics alive since forever. With McDonald's and Krispy Kreme fueling the diabetes fire, NVO's gonna be laughing all the way to the bank.
* **Sanofi (SNY):** Don't sleep on Sanofi. They're a powerhouse in the diabetes market, and with the MCD-Krispy collab causing chaos, their insulin sales are gonna skyrocket.

**Bottom Line:**

We're not just investing in stocks here, fam. We're investing in a lifestyle. With McDonald's and Krispy Kreme pumping out more sugar than Willy Wonka, we're riding the insulin wave straight to tendie town.

SOUN is dogshit on a stick,120,1bockso,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bockso/soun_is_dogshit_on_a_stick/,67,1711471636.0,"SOUN is worth less than $1.  Here's why:

\- SOUN made $46mm in annual revenue in 2023.  Current market cap is $1.9 billion.  That 42 times sales. This is 1999-2000 dot-com bubble level stupidity.  Even when the stock gets to $1/share, the market cap would be around 7 times sales, which is still ridiculously high for this garbage.

\- SOUN has never made a profit.  Again, for all the regards: this company loses money every quarter and every year and always has.

\- Raised $140 million in its 2021 IPO and burned $148 million of cash in 2022 and 2023

How does SOUN generate cash to pay its CEO and its employees?  By issuing equity, diluting shareholders.  

\- Current cash on hand (as of 12/31/23) was $95 million.  SOUN burns approximately $15-$20 million of cash each quarter (using Cash Flow from Operations as a proxy for cash burn).  As of today (3/26/24), that means SOUN probably has around $75 million of cash.  Mininum cash for a garbage heap like this company is $25-$50 million.  That means the company will need to raise cash again between today and one quarter from today.  That means on some random day in the next 3 months, we will get a press release saying they're issuing equity and all your shares are automatically worth less (and the stock will probably drop 5-15% that day alone).

\- SOUN fired its last financial auditor UHY in April 2022 because it said multiple times that SOUN had issues as ""of a matter for going conern"" ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390022023274/ea159193-8k\_soundhound.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390022023274/ea159193-8k_soundhound.htm)) which is a polite way to say that SOUN is a dogshit company on a stick.  Then SOUN hired Armanino LLP as auditor which resigned in July 2023 and was replaced by PWC.  Guess what PWC had to say?? 

\- PWC wrote in SOUN's 2023 10'K: “In our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.”  So basically, you can't trust the financial statements.  

\- SOUN missed estimates for 4Q23 revenue and 4Q23 earnings loss.

\- SOUN competes against Alexa, Siri, and Google's Assistant.  Really?  These titans will squash SOUN like a cockroach

\- SOUN's CEO is selling shares.  He sold at least 658,000 shares in several batches after the stock starting pumping in February 2024

\- ""bUT NVIDIA iNVestED in SOUn!!""  Yes, Nvidia filed a 13F with the SEC on 2/14/23 that said it did in fact have an investment in SOUN.  However, what the financial press hides from retail is that Nvidia made this investment 7 years ago and it invested only $3.7 million!!  It was not a new investment, and Nvidia has not invested anything more into SOUN in the last 7 years since the initial investment.

TLDR: SOUN is a pile of garbage riding the AI frenzy. This is mostly a pump and dump currently in the dumping phase.  Look at the 1-6 month charts similar pump and dump schemese [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) and BBAI to see what is going to happen with SOUN.  of Even the CEO is using retail SOUN buyers as exit liquidity.  

Positions: I'm short 4300 shares at $6.97.  My price target is $1/share",2024-03-26 16:47:16,2024-03-26 16:47:16+00:00

Now that you've enjoyed the pretty pictures and big fat fonts, we pre-school explain it further here for your pre-school reading pleasure.

If you haven't heard of the legendary rabbit+zoo they pulled out of their hat this last earnings, you don't deserve to call yourself an ape trader, you're more like a  caculus spider monkey too caught up in patterns and logic to appreciate this magical feat. But seriously, Micron is what I've loaded on. Let me post their earnings vs expected so you can appreciate the sheer mythological times we currently live in:

March 20th 2024, that magical date... sigh....

Q2 2024 :

* **Earnings per share:** 42 cents adjusted vs. 25 cent loss expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $5.82 billion vs. 5.35 billion expected by LSEG.

Micron said revenue rose to $5.82 billion from $3.69 billion in the year ago quarter. The company reported a net income of $793 million, up from a net loss of $2.3 billion in the same period last year. (ohhh and that pretty guidance into next Qtr.... )

**For its fiscal third quarter, Micron expects to report revenue of $6.6 billion, above the $6.02 billion expected by analysts. ( these mofo's will be busy for YEARS to come pumping out the storage capacity for the AI revolution )**

“We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a release.

Micron has long provided memory and flash storage for computers, data centers and phones. Large data centers are used to power the influx of new AI software. While Nvidia has grabbed much of the spotlight for its graphics processing units that run AI, companies like Micron benefit by providing the memory and storage for those systems.

Check out this premonition anouncement A YEAR OLD on their wicked SOLID STATE SUPER MASSIVE STORAGE FOR DATA CENTERS:

## New Micron 9400 SSD delivers best-in-class performance and capacity

BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 09, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc., (Nasdaq: MU), today announced the Micron 9400 NVMe™ SSD is in volume production and immediately available from channel partners and to global OEM customers for use in servers requiring the highest levels of storage performance. The Micron 9400 is designed to manage the most demanding data center workloads, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) training, machine learning (ML) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. **The drive delivers an industry-leading 30.72 terabytes (TB) of storage capacity, superior workload performance versus the competition, and 77% improved input/output operations per second (IOPS).1 The Micron 9400 is the world’s fastest PCIe Gen4 data center U.3 drive shipping2 and delivers consistently low latency at all capacity points.3**

**“High performance, capacity and low latency are critical features for enterprises seeking to maximize their investments in AI/ML and supercomputing systems,” said Alvaro Toledo, vice president and general manager of data center storage at Micron. “Thanks to its industry-leading 30TB capacity and stunning performance with over 1 million IOPS in mixed workloads, the Micron 9400 SSD packs larger datasets into each server and accelerates machine learning training, which equips users to squeeze more out of their GPUs.”**

**Industry-leading 30TB capacity maximizes storage density**The Micron 9400 SSD’s industry-leading capacity of 30TB doubles the maximum capacity of Micron’s prior-generation NVMe SSDs. A standard two-rack-unit 24-drive server loaded with 30.72TB Micron 9400 SSDs provides total storage of **737TB per server.** By doubling capacity per SSD, Micron is enabling enterprises to store the same amount of data in half as many servers.

**Leading storage performance** **excels in a range of environments from** ***AI to cloud***The Micron 9400 SSD sets a new performance standard for PCIe Gen4 storage by delivering 1.6M IOPS for 100% 4K random reads.

The Micron 9400’s capacity and performance enable larger datasets and accelerate epoch time, the total number of iterations of data in one cycle for training machine learning models – leading to more efficient utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs).

While many SSDs are designed for pure read or write use cases, the Micron 9400 was designed with real-world applications in mind. Mixed workloads are prevalent in many data center applications, including caching, online transaction processing, high-frequency trading, AI, and performance-focused databases requiring extreme performance.

For mixed read and write workloads, the Micron 9400 also outperforms the competition, providing:

* 71% higher IOPS for 90% read and 10% write workloads, surpassing 1 million IOPS4
* 69% higher IOPS for 70% read and 30% write workloads, surpassing 940,000 IOPS4

In testing scenarios, the Micron 9400 SSD excelled in mixed workload performance compared against competitors’ high-performance NVMe SSDs. The results show:

* **For RocksDB,** a storage database renowned for its high performance and used for latency-sensitive, user-sensitive applications like spam detection or storing viewer history, the 9400 delivered up to 23% higher performance and up to 34% higher workload responsiveness5
* **For Aerospike Database**, an open-source NoSQL database optimized for flash storage, the Micron 9400 demonstrated up to 2.1 times higher peak performance and superior responsiveness. Aerospike Database underpins time-critical web applications like fraud detection, recommendation engines, real-time payment processing and stock trading – meaning the 9400 can deliver faster results for these time-sensitive use cases5
* **For NVIDIA Magnum IO GPUDirect Storage** which enables a direct memory access data transfer path between GPU memory and storage, the Micron 9400 beat the competition by delivering 25% better performance in a busy system with compute-bound tasks — a critical improvement for AI environments6
* **For multi-tenant cloud architectures**, the Micron 9400 delivers more than double the overall performance of a competitor’s performance-focused SSD and up to 62% better response time6

“As the world’s most innovative organizations continue to adopt cloud and digital-first strategies, WEKA and our partners are focused on removing obstacles to data-driven innovation,” said Liran Zvibel, co-founder and chief executive officer of WEKA. “High-performance, high-capacity storage like the Micron 9400 SSD provides the critical underlying technology to accelerate access to data and time to insights that drive tremendous business value.”

**Improved energy efficiency reduces environmental impact**A major consideration for data center operators is the combination of workload performance and the amount of energy consumed. Higher energy efficiency means there is more throughput for the energy consumed to complete the work. The Micron 9400’s 77% better IOPS per watt reduces power consumption and therefore operational expenses, carbon footprint and environmental impact.

“Supermicro designs innovative servers that provide maximum performance, configurability, and power savings to tackle the growing customer demand for increased capacity and efficiency,” said Wally Liaw, co-founder and senior vice president of business development at Supermicro. “The Micron 9400 SSD delivers an immense storage volume of over 30TB into every drive while simultaneously supporting optimized workloads and faster system throughput for advanced applications.”

**Various capacities offer enterprises flexible deployment**The Micron 9400 SSD is available in a U.3 form factor that is backwards-compatible with U.2 sockets and comes in capacities ranging from 6.4TB to 30.72TB. These options provide data center operators the flexibility to deploy the most energy efficient storage while matching their workloads with the right blend of performance, capacity and endurance.7 This versatile SSD is built to manage critical workloads whether in on-premises server farms or in a multi-tenant shared cloud infrastructure, and can be flexibly deployed in hyperscale, cloud, data center, OEM and system integrator designs.

Micron’s 24GB 8H HBM3E will be part of [NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-WFOC0TrTxRxyU8kfIeQAJS1H7seySCpwZJsJK-rMl2POkH0TYdt1itbwNGVyhyZk5ZIKIEeoRtiKn6F6Zg4dloqcHCCFSwERu3KxHwcX2dOBZD-TslIO_RCd81mlov4q1oLQFjnIDrua8TpZ5ij6g==), which will begin shipping in the second calendar quarter of 2024. This milestone positions Micron at the forefront of the industry, empowering artificial intelligence (AI) solutions with HBM3E’s industry-leading performance and energy efficiency.

**HBM3E: Fueling the AI Revolution**As the demand for AI continues to surge, the need for memory solutions to keep pace with expanded workloads is critical. Micron’s HBM3E solution addresses this challenge head-on with:

* **Superior Performance:** With pin speed greater than **9.2 gigabits per second (Gb/s)**, Micron’s HBM3E delivers more than **1.2 terabytes per second (TB/s**) of memory bandwidth, enabling lightning-fast data access for AI accelerators, supercomputers, and data centers.
* **Exceptional Efficiency:** Micron’s HBM3E leads the industry with **\~30%** **lower power consumption** compared to competitive offerings. To support increasing demand and usage of AI, HBM3E offers maximum throughput with the lowest levels of power consumption to improve important data center operational expense metrics.
* **Seamless Scalability:** With **24 GB of capacity** today, Micron’s HBM3E allows data centers to seamlessly scale their AI applications. Whether for training massive neural networks or accelerating inferencing tasks, Micron’s solution provides the necessary memory bandwidth.

“Micron is delivering a trifecta with this HBM3E milestone: time-to-market leadership, best-in-class industry performance, and a differentiated power efficiency profile,” said Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer at Micron Technology. “AI workloads are heavily reliant on memory bandwidth and capacity, and Micron is very well-positioned to support the significant AI growth ahead through our industry-leading HBM3E and HBM4 roadmap, as well as our full portfolio of DRAM and NAND solutions for AI applications.”

Micron developed this industry-leading HBM3E design using its 1-beta technology, advanced through-silicon via (TSV), and other innovations that enable a differentiated packaging solution. Micron, a proven leader in memory for 2.5D/3D-stacking and advanced packaging technologies, is proud to be a partner in TSMC’s 3DFabric Alliance and to help shape the future of semiconductor and system innovations.

Micron is also extending its leadership with the sampling of 36GB 12-High HBM3E, which is set to deliver greater than 1.2 TB/s performance and superior energy efficiency compared to competitive solutions, in March 2024.

Boeing on Monday announced a management shakeup that includes Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun stepping down at the end of the year. Stan Deal, the embattled chief of Boeing’s commercial airplane division, is departing immediately and will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Pope.

Additionally, DNUT aims to penetrate three to five new markets this year, eyeing Europe and Brazil among its top targets.

Strategic Alliances and Market Dynamics

Aptiv's Smart Vehicle Architecture

Per their 10K- Together, our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles, providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment

They do have quite a bit of debt I think that is priced in the stock and with rates going down this may present an opportunity to refinance

comparing tesla especially for autonomous driving this may be a undervalued bet. Not sure If I'm missing something here.

🦿🚀 EMBRACE THE PROSTHETIC BOOM: WHAT THE MCDONALD'S & KRISPY KREME'S COLLAB WILL DO TO PROSTHETIC MARKET! 🚀🍩,28,1bojkri,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bojkri/embrace_the_prosthetic_boom_what_the_mcdonalds/,24,1711488250.0," Alright, listen up, fellow apes! We're diving headfirst into prosthetics, where the real cash is flowing faster than a supersized soda. Thanks to McDonald's and Krispy Kreme, we're in for a sweet ride, but hold onto your prosthetic limbs, because here's the scoop:

**The Sugar-Pumped Surge**  
Diabetes ain't just a word—it's a moneymaker. With more folks losing limbs due to diabetes-related complications, the demand for human prosthetics is about to explode like an overstuffed doughnut.

Now, let's break down the top players in the game and see how they're poised to cash in on this sweet opportunity:

&#x200B;

 **1. Össur (OTCMKTS: OSSR):** Össur is like the Elon Musk of prosthetics, cooking up innovations faster than you can say ""rocket ship."" From bionic limbs to cyborg-level braces, Össur's got the tech to make real life sex dolls.

**2. Touch Bionics:** Touch Bionics specializes in cutting-edge myoelectric prosthetic hands, including their iconic i-limb series. With natural-looking and intuitive control, Touch Bionics is changing the game for upper limb amputees.

**3. Hanger, Inc. (OTCMKTS: HNGR):** Hanger, Inc. isn't just about prosthetic devices; they're all about comprehensive patient care. From custom prosthetics to rehabilitation services, Hanger is there every step of the way for amputees.

**4. Freedom Innovations:** has the word freedom in it.

**Bottom Line**  
We're not just talking tendies we're talking life-changing investments. By jumping on the prosthetic bandwagon fueled by McDonald's and Krispy Kreme, we're not just making bank off obese and wheelchair bound people, we're making a difference in the lives of amputees everywhere.

TSLA 420.69 by end of the year,58,1bollba,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bollba/tsla_42069_by_end_of_the_year/,95,1711492988.0,"Hi regards,

I am pissed. TSLA just go down and down and down everyday. I bought the dip on stock, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on calls, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on the car itself, well at least the car price stopped dipping. But only after I got the car, then I realize how good the car is.

Then I asked myself, why the stock keeps going down? checked on X, everybody said interest rate is too high, demand problem etc. I was thinking, everybody around me seems fine, **Papa Powell said the US economy is robust, job market remain tight etc, overall, everything fine!**

But still... we got a problem, that's fine... but more importantly how are we gonna **solve this problem**? ads put on youtube, X, now even on facebook,so where are the demands? where?

here is what I did. I am so broke, I pulled out my phone, registered uber. Went on the road and make some $$$ buy more tsla calls.

**why uber? because people who use uber are either:**

1. **Does not have a car (potential buyer).**
2. **have a car, can't drive themselves, but need transportation. (potential FSD buyer)**
3. **Uber is MULTI-NATIONAL, regards all over the world can participate in this. If we regards can pull this off, imagine suddenly tesla uber showing up everywhere in the world overnight. Tesla gain more awareness, lead to demand picking up. I'm pretty sure they will make another movie about it.**
4. **Get paid while doing this, Ubering in Tesla/EVs has a HUGE advantage over ICE when doing short trip. If you calculate the math, its about 13-25% more earnings. It's roughly about $23- $26/ hour before mileage deduction**
5. if you are 100% tsla, you gonna need to drive uber to supplement some income anyway.

I have done 200 trips so far. This is what I gathered from this small sample size.

1. lots of people (25% at least) doesn't even know how to open the tesla door!!!! that means they didn't even get into one of the tesla yet. At least in my area, that's the situation.
2. They LOVE LOVE LOVE the white interior and the roof, said they have never experience a car so clean and elegant! I said yeah Tesla is great, but I didn't say I clean the mess after they left everytime.
3. Lots of people asking me about the range anxiety, their information is still lagged in 2019. they don't know how long is the battery range, they don't know how fast the battery charge at home and super charger, they just don't know.
4. Lots of people asking me about the how does driving tesla feels like? I replied with my broken English to them, listed all the pros, cons I know of. They are very very surprised on no oil change for tesla.
5. Lots of people still think tesla is a 60k+ car instead of 30k-40k car.
6. Some customers specifically ordered uber green/ green comfort, I asked them why is that, they said the Tesla experience is too good.
7. Some people's friend went tesla, they can never go back to ICE.

There are many more, but my smooth brain cant list all of them out.

&#x200B;

**So in the end my smooth brain concluded that, these mfs just don't know!!!! The product is awsome@@! but they just don't know!!!! They are NOT gonna buy if they don't know!!! That's why we got a demand problem!!! Thats why the stock is dipping and dipping and dipping@@!**

&#x200B;

**So I propose Mission TSLA$420.69 to all of those regards AROUND THE WORLD have major TSLA position, and have a tesla car.**

1. uber, spread the words. Uber has destination mode, you can pick up some folks on your way to work/school, and on your way back home.
2. if you know how to create website or any other way/ form of plateform, create one. and let All the people who want to participate this together register. get each driver a QR code to post on the back of the driver/ passenger seat. Beside the QR code reads something like...""Scan here if you like to know more about my tesla experience"".
3. uber rider then can scan QR code, sound will pop up from their phone, driver start sharing. Be objective, say the pros, but make sure you also don't left out the cons. Honesty and sincerity is the best way.
4. also Post your referral link QR behind the seat
5. and then we can even let the rider take some sort of survey etc. to collect some data
6. let riders record a 10 sec vid of what they what to tell elon, if we manage to pull this off, mail it to elon
7. we can brainstorm more

&#x200B;

**More people know about it and experience it, more Teslas will be sold. Then We go tendie town.**

Not financial advise, you do you.
