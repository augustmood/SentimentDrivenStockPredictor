"$RUM puts for tomorrow, target of 5.5$",128,1bpikuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bpikuj/rum_puts_for_tomorrow_target_of_55/,57,1711587509.0,"Hello fellow well regarded individuals,

I present my DD analysis on the ticker $RUM. I've tried posting this DD last night due to the upcoming earnings for the following day, however I had failed to meet the karma requirement. Now I am back with a proper analysis after we've learnt about the earnings report that came out AH today.

So let's go over a short summary of the numbers

Rumble has a short interest of 4.96% as of February 29, 2024.

Rumble has been up nearly 60% since january 18th's pump and has been lying in a rising wedge for countless weeks in the anticipation for $DWAC and the truth social merger. There's also the case for Rumble cloud, but that is a nonexistent market right now and will likely be for the rest of 2025 to 2027.

https://preview.redd.it/8yh988wayyqc1.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=29cea98436585d15c8fbe6335a17fc3ad9a4b990

Now, here's where it gets fun :)

So Rumble reported their latest quarterly earnings for fiscal Q4 2023 and there's a eps of -0.14 vs -0.22, however the revenue generated was much less than anticipated. Although the reported revenue was YOY 106% from 2022 to 2023, the company had undertook a massive hit in terms of revenue costs for 20mill vs the expected result of 28mill. Their expenses rose by nearly 40%, their net loss from operating activities rose by over 100x and current assets dropping by 35% through YoY from the prior year.

Now, although this company may try to stay afloat, their main source of income relies on analytics, this play however will act as a short term correction to earlier supports to retest resistence. There are 15.260k calls and 5.240k puts open from closing that will expire tomorrow. This also carries an IV% of 360.99%, however if you look at the rest of the options chain you'll see something different compared to $DJT...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jq15qj2a1zqc1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a30d5bb083a100e530669140852ee5b73100b4

Unlike $DJT, the IV seems to go down as more time progresses, meaning the puts and calls are cheaper with very low open interest.

For the near term, I expect these calls to backfire and draw puts options in the short term window here to go higher due to an expected correction. Now, it is probably going to start tomorrow as the wick forms on the daily close. However, it may expand into next week where we start expecting the targets.

The probably targets for tomorrow morning are either 8.8$, or more likely 7.8$. We know that in AH, trading already fell through the 200day moving average twice. This can in turn lead to a bigger downside that will open to the 14 day RSI at 7.41. As for how low we'll go in this cycle, I would say as low as 5.5$.

We're also close toa  death cross in the 50day ma vs the 200day ma on the 1day chart, which is expected to occur tomorrow if we continue to decline (purple lines). Although in general 9day, 18day, 20day and 150day ma are already crossed so we are at the debut of a bearish reversal.

&#x200B;

I think we will trigger this cycle tomorrow and you may disregard my regarded stance, however there's  likely minimal risks for this trade and it is relatively small at a short gain of \~35%, with a lower possibility of going much lower, however it is possible as well.

Now, there's also very little short interest. If other investors flock to open shorts before the rest of the market, you may be locked out before the dump and rely on forward contracts for puts.

See you regards tomorrow and if I am wrong, then I'll see you at Wendy's.

Step 2: Sell to open April 5th $3.5 covered call and collect premium. Repeat weekly until the price of SOXS rises above strike and it executes. 

Step 3: The inverse SOXL should be down on price, take proceeds from step 2 and buy as much as possible. Wait for semiconductor prices to rise. 

Step 4: once SOXX plateaus, sell SOXL. Take proceeds from the sale and go back to step 1.

Chips are a good play.

Operating systems have been a good play.

AI is a good play.

Processing is cool.

When you put all these things together, you get some serious computer power. From that comes data. A shit load of data. 

As much as AI is overblown, \[and if people actually knew what it really was (think program ETF), they'ld calm the f\*ck down a bit\] it pulls in a lot of data, processes it and spits it back out in a new form. That new data needs to go somewhere.

You need to have a massive storage bank to pull from, somewhere to shove the new found data and quickly.

At the rate computational power is accelerating, data won't just be doubling, it will be far beyond that.

Sure, clouds are great but they're also public and easily hackable today. Businesses that depends on secrecy so their ideas don't get stolen and ""crunched"" by a bigger outfit need somewhere to hold those bytes without spending an arm and a leg.

I introduce Micron Technology Inc. (Ticker $MU)

With a current work force of 34,000, partnerships with multiple big name chip manufacturers, processor manufactures and Verification IP Partners, the future looks bright for Micron.

[Full partnership list here.](https://www.micron.com/partners/partner-networks)

&#x200B;

The big boys in the short game have completely screwed themselves on this one.

There are some major sized institutional longs (Blackrock and Vanguard up top as always) but shorts have tried to average up to the point where they're guaranteed to implode when Micron takes off again.

Their current dark pool position looks like this:

For a year, shorts have been forced to average up to a $7B position and haven't been able to balance out. Someone will get blown to hell on this one shortly.

With only one split (2:1 - 05/02/2000) in the history of this 46 year old company, it has a long way to go.

\- Blowing up that dark pool position will find a stupid high before things settle down around the $180-190 area.

\- Next earnings expected end of June.

Position: Weekly Calls $140-150 until things settle down. Then I'll look at shares and sell calls.

robinhood specifies they have to be new gold users. new gold users are forced to do a 30 day trial. robinhood will not tell you they started the trial, you will only get a email once they pay their first month and you get the referral. lets say you convinced your friends to sign up for robinhood with their social security number and got them to do the trail using your link, or you are paying people 50$ for their ref like me. if one of them doesent understand they need to pay the first month, and cancels it before, or someone just wanted to scam you, or robinhood just didnt count the ref . only after a month will you learn that you still need 1 more ref which will take another month. of course, there is a limited supply, so you better hope they dont run out while you wait your 30 days.

I’m aware that they just reported earnings yesterday and missed expectations. The problem I have with this is that most analysts don’t dig deep into the financial statements of companies that aren’t worth their time. The reason i’m classifying this as a good trade is because I believe there’s possible upside to the $17-18 range or even a little bit higher, taking into account the very low downside / risk involved. A few things that stood out to me in the 10-k are as followed.
1. Net Income - FY2022 (313.1M) FY2023 (6.7M) This one is by far and away the more under looked aspect of the ER. Yes they missed sales but that makes the increase of revenue that much more astonishing. 
2. A decrease in accounts payable of 207.3M YoY. 
3. SG&A expenses decreased 357.1M (21.2%) YoY which most likely attributed to the rise in net income.

The transaction was executed at an average price of $32.3 per share, resulting in a total value of $16,150,000.

Reddit Inc operates as a social media platform where users submit content such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. The platform is known for its diverse and active community, where discussions span a wide range of topics from news and politics to hobbies and pop culture.

Over the past year, the insider has engaged in the sale of 500,000 shares and has not made any purchases of Reddit Inc stock. The recent sale by Steve Huffman represents a significant transaction and is part of a broader pattern of insider activity at the company.

On the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of Reddit Inc were trading at $32.3, giving the company a market capitalization of $9.182 billion. The price-earnings ratio of Reddit Inc stands at 493.59, which is substantially higher than both the industry median of 21.18 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio.

The insider's sale could be interpreted in various ways by investors and market analysts. However, it is essential to consider the transaction within the broader context of the company's performance, market conditions, and the insider's historical trading patterns.

Don't sleep on RILY guys - Shorts could be in for some serious pain,3,1bprm8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bprm8m/dont_sleep_on_rily_guys_shorts_could_be_in_for/,2,1711619332.0,"Summary upfront: Lots of KPI's and catalysts lining up on RILY to screw the shorts, but there are risks.

So I know a couple of really solid DD's have been done on RILY already, but I think the timing is potentially great to get in the stock now. Again this is not NFA, I assume you guys will be doing your own detailed DD before deciding to part with your money. None of you are degen gamblers.

The stock is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. 76% short. This is as of March 15th. Last two weeks decent chance it has only gone higher, but again, point is, it is heavily shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/xitgpdzql1rc1.png?width=1861&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0036e2cc885a9be2d5c7f2fcdd1f2c3b2f8fd2

Now lets be real, the stock is shorted due to many reasons:

* Shorts are sure this is going to zero as the shorts claim the company is a fraud
* The company has not been able to file its audited 10k on time. The deadline was Feb 28th, extension to Mar 15. The company has now till May 18th to provide Nasdaq with a plan to get this sorted otherwise risk being delisted. This is obviously a big red flag and the point that is helping the short case a lot. However....

The company just last night did a SEC filing:  
[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1464790/000121390024026575/ea0202739-8k\_briley.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1464790/000121390024026575/ea0202739-8k_briley.htm)

I know you guys wont read, so will it paste the relevant part:  


""In light of the delayed filing of B. Riley Financial, Inc.’s (the “Company”) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”), the Company has secured an extension under its existing credit agreement with Nomura Corporate Funding Americas, LLC (as administrative agent to the lenders) of the time required to deliver its 2023 audited financial statements to the administrative agent.

**While the Company does not believe it will require the full period, the lenders have agreed that the audited financials need not be delivered until April 29, 2024. The Company did not incur any additional fees as a result of the extension.**

The Company acknowledges the key role its lenders and other counterparties have played in its growth and success and, as evidenced by the extension, continues to maintain an ongoing and productive dialogue with its lenders even through this temporary delay.""  


This means a few things:

* The biggest lenders of the company are sure an audited 10k will be filed. They must have been shown a plan before agreeing
* The company believes that an audited 10k is coming soon

Now the last piece of the puzzle. At what price the shorts will start worrying?:

https://preview.redd.it/qnst1x19n1rc1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f91b7b78a97a8efed7f1e870dbc0c724473997c

So basically anything over 22-24 range, more than half the shorts will feel the pinch. Stock is at $20 in pre market.

So now we have a situation where the stock is 76% shorts around 12m shares, we got a positive catalyst yesterday, shorts might need to do some covering, but the question is from where?  


[source: https:\/\/www.gurufocus.com\/stock\/RILY\/ownership](https://preview.redd.it/ksdenyrfo1rc1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b265f627a97d23796a9316fc1d9dfa68810aa01)

The freely traded float of this stock is super low. The daily volume has been under 1m. Simply put just not enough shares going around. Some buying pressure and the shorts will be caught with their pants down.   


**TLDR**

* RILY is one of the most heavily shorted stock on the market, with 76% short
* Shorts have a case as 10k is delayed and they owe response to NASDAQ and there is risk of delisting. Stock could be a fraud and go to zero
* However, Company got an extension from their lenders to file the 10k. A positive catalyst
* There is a firm deadline on April 29th to file the audited 10k.  In the latest filing the company is confident it will get done by then. Positive catalyst 2
* ALl the KPI's to screw the shorts are there: Cost to borrow is 95%, Utilization is 99%, Low free float, Short interest is 76%. Price at 20 right now, around 23-24 could create some panic in the shorts. Stock just needs some buying momentum. 

Buy when there is blood on the street, plus the meltdown of shorts on twitter is just amazing. 

**Positions**

* Holding 1k shares, which is no interest to you guys

but the ones that interest you:

If you are holding long positions  in anything, be cautious, as it may not be possible to close your  positions tomorrow. You might see a significant gap at next week's  opening. Pray this Easter, not just for spiritual reasons, but also for  the sake of your fucking-bets! Amen

Ticker:PWDY acquisition imminent,2,1bpuvz2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bpuvz2,3,1711630381.0,"
Yesterday after hours Powerdyne international filed a 14c where insiders voted to increase AS by 50%. In the filing it says reason is acquisition and mergers. Everyone wanted to scream dilution and run for the hills but have yet to realize this company has not once ever created notes and diluted the company. 

Today in the early morning they tweeted out that they are going to use the increase in AS as collateral for a bridge loan.

This loan will be used to quickly acquire a new company, most likely composite motors listed below. Once bridge loan is used they will be granted larger long term financing that will be able to be paid off from the incoming companies profits. 

This is my take on the current information provided. Please take a look at pictures in this post for more info 

massive move imminent as 10k and potential acquisition news unfold this week
 

 Massive influx in recent volume shows major move is underway. Catalyst upcoming: 10Q anything over 1.5 mil revs would be fantastic.
Expecting acquisition to expand business

OS: 1.85B
AS: 2 B
Price:.0022
Marketcap:$4,100,000
Average 5 day volume: 10 mil
Past 5 trading days: 450 mil
4500% increase
Share structure maxed
275k assets on hand on last 10Q
1.2 million revs for the prior 10k 

MONDAY the current 10k is to be released and revs are expected to be record for this company potentially breaking 1.5 million 

Unlike most OTC companies
Powerdyne actually accrues revenue and profits of substantial amount.
Their business is generated from a 2022 acquisition of creative motion technology. Which included CM tech, a motor production company. These motors serve factory automation robots.(Al)

Along with the acquisition of CM tech was ""Frame One"". A custom framing shop. Frame One has been in business Since 2006 and brings with it a strong client base of local schools, colleges, artists, interior decorators/designers, museums, photographers, art galleries and theaters. This may seem quite simple but it generates revenue and thats more than what 99% of otc ceos can do.

The company's ceo has previously acknowledged Al. The CM tech company producing motors supplies semiconductor companies with these motor where they are creating chips for the purpose of Al.
With the ongoing emergence and growth 
“With the ongoing emergence and growth of artificial intelligence (Al) we are anticipating and preparing for an increase in demand for
CM Tech's custom designed motors. Currently,
CM Tech does not directly supply the Al market but supplies the motors to the semiconductor equipment manufacturers who produce and service the automated equipment that is responsible for making the silicon wafers used in the micro processing chips. These microchips are used in Al as well as in smart TVs, cell phones, computers, and virtually every smart device produced today.”

CEO also states about acquisition: “CM Tech is now currently evaluating some local motor manufacturing companies as potential acquisition candidates which will increase our market presence in the medical, robotic, and unmanned vehicles sectors. In addition to providing new market opportunities, it would also provide the Company with additional experience in sales and technical support. CM Tech is also working to enter these markets on our own but doing it via an acquisition would save us time and capital since the gestion period is 6 months plus to get new products introduced into these markets.”

Next expected update will be the annual report which is expect to boast 1.4 million revenue.
Fundamentally this company is undervalued.
Any acquisition that's focused on Al or something that will bring substantially more revenue and I speculate a big run will take place here.
 CEO owns 11.6% of OS
Recent buys in August of 1.5 million shares
Total holding is 216 million

Insider ownership from 2022 filing at 50%. 

Stock is picking up movement and creating a stir on twitter I fully expect this to start running hard. 

Im suspecting a major acquisition to be announced next week. PT is .035 which would be almost a 15x from current prices.

Back to the acquisition at hand. 

In August 2023, management put out a shareholder letter that discussed how they were currently evaluating acquisition candidates.
This acquisition would help gain a presence in the medical, robotic, and UAV sectors. It would also provide experience in sales and technical support, and begin to redevelop their presence in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean Islands.
I believe I have found the acquisition target. After searching close to 50 local motor manufacturing companies, the only private company that fits all of these criteria is Composite Motors, Inc.
Note that is speculation, but I put a lot of time into this search and this company is the most probable IMO. Please do your own DD.

Composite Motors, Inc. (CMI) was founded in Attleboro, MA in 1966, which is about an hour drive from the current office. They expanded to FL location in 2001 with manufacturing at both locations.

Composite Motors, Inc. appears to do roughly $25M in annual revenue, with between 60-120 employees depending on different sources.
This is a realistic sized acquisition target, especially considering it has audited fins and almost no debt.

Composite Motors, Inc. caters to every sector that was mentioned in the $PWDY shareholder letter.
JOL
- Medical
- Robotics
- Aerospace/Military (UAVs)

In regard to the experience in sales and technical support, Composite Motors, Inc. definitely fits the bill.
They have the established history and team size to provide strong sales and technical expertise.

One interesting note in the shareholder letter, was that they want to redevelop their presence in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean Islands. Composite Motors having office/manufacturing in Florida as well as Massachusetts is another sign they are the target - location.

Everything about Composite Motors makes sense as an acquisition target.
It fits the description of the shareholder letter, and there are limited options for MA motor manufacturers. With the 10-K due next week, I'm excited to see any new details on acquisition progress...

Consider taking a position as 10k will be released Monday, otc annuals due 3/31 but that’s Sunday so they will be released on Monday. Market is closed tomorrow!

Where did Tesla go wrong? The once red-hot electric automaker was considered to be a part of the Magnificent Seven, a collection of behemoth tech stocks with some pretty recognizable names. Now? Tesla is considered to be one of the worst-performing stocks of the entire S&P 500 during a time where we are seeing some of the highest highs in the market. 

Well, fasten your seatbelts because here we go:

1.

2. The electric vehicle industry as a whole is becoming more **crowded** than ever before at the absolute **worst time** for the company, just as its fundamentals are coming into question. To date the company's share price has dropped more than **60%** from its 2021 all-time high of $407.
3. This cramped competition can be realized even further with the fact that China’s electric vehicle champion, BYD, has **overtaken** Tesla as the **largest** EV producer in the world, with a 22% increase in global sales for Q4 of last year, surpassing Tesla by over 41,000 units.

4. After **missing** expectations on the company's reported earnings earlier this year, it has become apparent that demand for electric vehicles has **declined** and is notably lower than last year. The company seems to be **stuck** between two major growth phases as it works on launching its next-generation vehicles. We can only hope that those new cars don’t have any major issues as the current generation of vehicles does; otherwise, Tesla could spiral into an even deeper rabbit hole than it currently is.

Where did Tesla go wrong? The once red-hot electric automaker was considered to be a part of the Magnificent Seven, a collection of behemoth tech stocks with some pretty recognizable names. Now? Tesla is considered to be one of the worst-performing stocks of the entire S&P 500 during a time where we are seeing some of the highest highs in the market.

2. The electric vehicle industry as a whole is becoming more **crowded** than ever before at the absolute **worst time** for the company, just as its fundamentals are coming into question. To date the company's share price has dropped more than **60%** from its 2021 all-time high of $407.
3. This cramped competition can be realized even further with the fact that China’s electric vehicle champion, BYD, has **overtaken** Tesla as the **largest** EV producer in the world, with a 22% increase in global sales for Q4 of last year, surpassing Tesla by over 41,000 units. This is bad news for Tesla as it begins to lose its **foothold** over the Asian region even further as its ***gap*** over the Chinese rival decreased from 400,000 units posted in 2022 to 230,000 units posted in 2023.
4. After **missing** expectations on the company's reported earnings earlier this year, it has become apparent that demand for electric vehicles has **declined** and is notably lower than last year. The company seems to be **stuck** between two major growth phases as it works on launching its next-generation vehicles. We can only hope that those new cars don’t have any major issues as the current generation of vehicles does; otherwise, Tesla could spiral into an even deeper rabbit hole than it currently is.

I've been testing the strategy for a month and I belive that it is now ready to be published. The process is quite simple. The stocks listed are all found by a screener which searches for some preliminary characteristics such as market cap, 1 year growth, and sector. Then, I input them into a formula I derived, which I edit to be more accurate by the day, to output my predictions for jumps and crashes at earnings call. What it does is it calculates the percent change in the stock between earnings announcementand 24 hours later. At the moment, the formula has an average error of 0.55%, an absolute average error of 3.2%, and an absolute average error excluding outliers of 2.2%. The most recent formula has a trend prediction rate of 80% and its accuracy is not that far off. I only trade based on it when it outputs large numbers on jumps or crashes, which so far, have not been wrong once. This chart helped me get on the jump earlier for stocks such as NVDA, DELL, CRWD, ORCL, and MU to go long for and ACN, MDB, MRVL, ZS, and SNOW to go short for. I usually will buy them around 24 hours before earnings. Now that earnings season ended, the next stocks predicted are NFLX, SAP, and CSGP for a month from now. Let me know if this helps!

So that led me to ticker APH, one of the largest providers of fiber connectors, sensors, and many other products that span into basically every industry. Even though I chose APH any other large company that specializes in producing fiber optic cables and connectors I think would be a wise investment.. Or gamble.. For years to come.

## These stocks aren't expensive, even at all-time highs

So I'm not saying that Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks should have tripled over the last year, like Nvidia. But their rebound from the rock-bottom pricing of the inflation crisis was slower than they deserved. I can't believe it took this long just to get back to prices last seen in November 2021.

And they're priced to keep on moving, too.

Shares of Amazon are changing hands at the bargain-bin valuation of 3.2 times sales. Alphabet's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) clocks in at 6.1. In a world where **Microsoft** (NASDAQ: MSFT) commands a double-digit P/S ratio and Nvidia has soared to 39 times sales, these figures strike me as big market-maker mistakes.

## Why Amazon and Alphabet aren't skyrocketing (yet)

Of course, Wall Street had its reasons to keep Alphabet and Amazon under wraps while most of their ""Magnificent Seven"" peers soared.

The digital advertising market fell into a deep recession in 2022. Inflationary pressure is no joke -- consumers held on to their wallets with both hands while everybody's cost of doing business rose. That's not a great environment for launching extravagant marketing campaigns. The economic pressure has subsided in recent quarters but I'm still not talking about a full-fledged return to optimal health. So Alphabet's ad-based business has seen slower growth than usual, and the stock arguably deserves a bit of a discount under these circumstances.",2024-03-28 15:39:05,2024-03-28 15:39:05+00:00

$GES- CEO Forcing Shorts to Pay for Their Own Squeeze by 4/16,9,1bpyqlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bpyqlg/ges_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/,4,1711640701.0,"*The last time a company with 20%+ short interest was able to pull off a special dividend greater than $1 was* ***($Rkt) rocket mortgage in 2021*** *which resulted in a massive short squeeze.*

So **$GES** CEO  Carlos Alberini  fuckin hates shorts almost as much as we do, and im going to outline what this absolute **CHAD** has planned for them.

His company Guess jeans literally smashes every ER by a country mile and hes tired of his stock being held down by these lazy greedy cocaine snorting short sellers.

Let me outline how this mega-autist CEO is going to force the **shorts to squeeze themselves by 4/16/2024**

GUESS was  established in 1981 by the Marciano brothers, who left the south of  France in pursuit of the American dream. Inspired by a European  influence, the Marcianos redefined denim.



* There is currently 27m share float
* 27% of those shares are short : 7,596,908 shares
* $1 billion dollar buyback program

**NOW THE FUN PART**

In their most recent investor meeting team $GES rolled up to the  shorts door like the dancing pallbearers and introduced a $2.40/share ***SPECIAL DIVIDEND*** on top of annual dividend  to be paid to anyone holding GES stock by 4/16/2024.

So.. what does this mean for shorts? We have arrived at the BD moment..

**SHORTS HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDEND**

Shorts have to pay $2.40 for every share they are short on 4/16/2024

BUYBACK PROGRAM

What else was in that juicy investor conference? Wait for it…

**$1 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK PROGRAM**

See, GES makes so much fucking money they can afford not only a  ***special dividend***, but a $1B share buyback. Im telling you this man is going  into the trenches and clearing the shorts out by his fucking self.

**TLDR:**

$GES is a boomer stock they thought was gonna go out of business when interest rates were raised and the opposite happened. GES has outperformed in earnings for the past year and is up 76% YTD. **Shorts have to cover** their \~7.6mm  shares or they are **forced to pay $2.40/share they are short on 4/16/2024**.

Also, if you can’t do math. If u buy shares and hold thru 4/6.. it’s an instant 12% return via the special dividend at least.

Edit: I always liked how a big ass looked in those jeans

$DXYZ - Fresh IPO giving public access to private tech unicorns,2,1bpz1mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bpz1mr/dxyz_fresh_ipo_giving_public_access_to_private/,1,1711641450.0," Strap in regards - We gotta talk about this one.

$DXYZ (Destiny Tech100) is  ""a closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act. We intend to invest in a portfolio of 100 of the top venture-backed private technology companies, providing everyday investors access to these private market leaders for the first time ""

🚀 **Why $DXYZ? Here's the Lowdown**: 🚀

1. **Undervalued Gem:** Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) isn't just another tech stock; it's an undervalued point of access to invest in the private superstars of today and the unicorns of tomorrow.  With holdings like SpaceX, OpenAI, Discord, and Stripe, $DXYZ is not just another tech stock. It's a portfolio of 100 of the top private technology companies, giving you a unique opportunity to invest in the future of innovation. They currently hold 32 companies on the roster and plan to fill to 100.
2. **Fresh on the Market:** Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) just hit the New York Stock Exchange on March 26, 2024, and it's already making waves. Opening at $8.25, it soared an impressive 70.5% from its reference price of $4.84, signaling strong investor interest right out of the gate.
3. **Institutional Interest:** Big players are starting to take notice. Institutional investors are showing interest in Destiny Tech100, recognizing the unique opportunity it presents to get in on the ground floor of tomorrow's tech giants.
4. **Ground-Floor Access:**  $DXYZ offers you, the regarded public, the key to the kingdom, providing ground floor access to some of the most prolific private tech unicorns shaping tomorrow's world before they ever see the public market.

🔍 **Why You Should Keep an Eye on $DXYZ**: 🔍

1. **Innovative Disruption:** Destiny Tech100 isn't just another stock; it's a beacon of intentional innovation. With its portfolio of top private technology companies, it's constantly pushing boundaries and reshaping industries. Destiny XYZ CEO Sohail Prasad said the following about the business:

>*“Our mission at D/XYZ is about more than just financial returns. We believe everyone should have a vested interest in the transformative companies they know, use, and love. Listing the Tech100 fund on the NYSE represents a significant step towards leveling the playing field, allowing anyone to invest in legendary private companies that we believe are making a GDP-level impact.”*

1. **Growth Potential:** The sky's the limit with $DXYZ. Since their prime category is pre-IPO investment, there is a real opportunity to achieve a 10x-50x return for many companies in their portfolio. As the tech sector continues to evolve and expand, so does the potential for growth. With its diverse holdings and visionary approach, $DXYZ is primed for growth.
2. **Market Momentum:** Momentum is building behind $DXYZ, and for good reason. With increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors, the stock is gaining traction and setting the stage for significant upside potential.
3. **Transparency and Accessibility:** Unlike traditional investment avenues, $DXYZ offers transparency and accessibility to everyday investors on their website. With clear insights into its holdings and a user-friendly platform, investing in $DXYZ is as easy as it is rewarding.

Positions: 28 shares

TL:DR for the target audience: These guys just IPO'd and grant exposure to some of the most prolific private companies around. Tech sector isn't going anywhere so you might as well get exposure to the best of the best.

Sure, maybe we can just put those trips on the Visa like last time, but now 30 day credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level since 2011. 

That trend isn’t stopping anytime soon since inflation significantly outpaced wages and credit cards are being used like stimulus checks. 

The first thing to go is travel spending and unless they have a pallet full of Nvidia Blackwell chips ready to jam into their e-machines for immaculate price arbitrage spreads, this one’s going down.

Today MSTR dropped from $1974 to $1700 with no fundamental changes in Bitcoin prices. In these events, it's good advice to ignore the headlines and trade based on technical analysis.

From graph estimates, it will likely head to regular prices by the next trading day (\~$1835 retrace) and back $1970s level by Tuesday (in the event there's no major fundamental changes with Bitcoin). If you trade based on headlines instead of TA you'll just be out of your positions to market makers.

Historically, this has only happened 3 times this year where a buying opportunity in MSTR occurs with oversold \~20 RSI - Jan 16th, March 19th, and Today.

Today hit the lowest RSI this entire year, hitting <15, meaning that MSTR was significantly oversold below the regular oversold levels, and implies price reversal.",2024-03-28 16:51:55,2024-03-28 16:51:55+00:00

Dairy cattle in Texas have been getting sick for several weeks, and the USDA released a statement today stating the cause is a strain of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza:

[https://www.nmpf.org/joint-dairy-organization-statement-on-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-cows/](https://www.nmpf.org/joint-dairy-organization-statement-on-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-cows/)

HPAI has had devastating effects in the poultry industry the past couple years. Remember when your $1 eggs went to $5? Zoetis has a vaccine for HPAI in chickens, but due to the short lifespan of a chicken and the cost involved with vaccinating 1,000,000 birds in some barns, it was more cost effective to cross your fingers, hope they didn't catch it, and if they did, you did a slightly more sophisticated version of what NVDA put holders did - close the garage doors and keep the engine running.

Not quite so simple or cost effective with a herd of dairy cattle. Those infected already will likely be culled and find their way into your local Wendys patty, but to limit further infection, I expect there will be a rush to vaccinate uninfected cattle. And you don't think they're going to put the cost of vaccination and the cost of mass producing it on our poor dairy farmers and pharmaceutical companies, do you? Here comes the US government to the rescue paying 10x a shot to encourage drug companies to ramp up production and a bunch of farmers who have been triggered by the word ""vaccine"" for 4 years to actually use it.

But the link says the disease is only in Texas and Kansas you may say. Wait a couple weeks. A lot of dairy heifers are raised in those states due to their favorable weather compared to WI, NY, and other large northern dairy states, so a lot of those heifers are catching it down there and getting shipped to their home herds daily. Idaho closed their borders to cattle last week, but they are the only state to do so thus far.

Why Zoetis? I work in the dairy industry and have known about this for a couple weeks, so when I saw a tweet from the Nancy Pelosi Stock Tracker that Rep. Shelley Moore bought $50k of Zoetis stock on 3/15, I chose them as my horse in this race. Moore is a ranking member of the Environmental & Public Works Committee. Merck is also rumored to have a vaccine, but ZTS has 1/4 of their market cap where this could have more effect.

TLDR: Cows sick, buy cow drug company.

I find it quite logical for this to be correct as each halving cycle is more heavily anticpated and there is more activity earlier on to adjust for it such as the introduction and rise of this year's ETF's. To test if this stratagey was probable, I took the daily percent changes of past halvings and shifted it to today (while deriving an equation to factor it into) to calculate trends on a week by week basis. I tried various models and adjusted them until I found the best fitting equation (labeled as the 16-20 Pattern Leverage in black). The numbers of the labels of the lines represent which year(s) I shifted over and utilized in my predicitons. I left it running for around 20 days and found the equation has predicted today's price to be only 750 more dollars! I use the old rainbow chart as a reference to see past patterns and points of fast growth (I understand it is a meme chart). However, it would be helpful to me if anyone knows the equations for the newly updated rainbow chart as I could not find them. I included a close up of future predictions below as well along with predicted growths in other cryptos and related stocks by analyzing the factor of increase between BTC and the respective stock/crypto.

Bloom Energy immediately denied this and said that they strongly disagree with the research, and the next day, they issued a massive rebuttal to Hindenburg.

Though, BE had already dropped, and Bloom, with its hyped IPO, faced problems with loads of lawsuits, investigations, and so on. They, by the way, decided to [settle this for $3M](https://11thestate.com/cases/be-ipo-settlement) with investors (in my opinion, they just bought their way out). 

But the ""Hindenburg"" vibe is still hanging around, and that report still pops up on the top when you googling Bloom. So, do you still think Bloom still remains the ""holy grail"", which may help them rise again and maybe absolve all sins in 2025?",2024-03-28 17:54:23,2024-03-28 17:54:23+00:00

Apple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up Overseas,2,1bq2p5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bq2p5k/apple_plans_new_ipad_pro_for_may_as_production/,8,1711650223.0,"Apple Inc.’s overseas suppliers have ramped up production of the company’s long-anticipated new iPads and a launch is planned for early May, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The release will center on revamped versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. As Bloomberg News has previously reported, the Pro models will get crisper new OLED displays — short for organic light-emitting diode — while the iPad Air will get a 12.9-inch screen option for the first time.

The move marks an end to the longest stretch without new models in the history of the iPad, which was first introduced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010. It’s been about 18 months since the last updates — a drought that’s contributed to already-sluggish demand for tablets. Apple is betting that the new models, with faster chips and revamped accessories, can help spur a renaissance for the category.

The Migrant crisis- currently there's about  200,000+ illegal migrants crossing over to the US every month. Thats like 1 Fort Lauderdale popping up once a month in the US. All these people need transportation, food and shelter. Luckily uncle sam is super nice and pays their rent because he has unlimited cash. What do landlords do? raise rent because its getting paid no matter what the cost. Uncle sam is also handing out visa gift cards and food stamps. Stimulus checks helped contribute to the peak 9% inflation a few years ago. I know we'll see more stimulus for the migrants before the election.

Commodity prices-Prices are rising over the past year. Partly due to the Suez canal(Yemen) and Ukraine conflict but also due to climate change. The Saudi's and Russia are cutting crude production to try and boost prices.

-Cocoa +247% over last year

-Orange Juice +62% over last year

Crude +22% over last year

-Coffee+15% over last year

Baltimore Port bridge collapse- The port's operations directly support 15,000 jobs. Indirectly another 140,000 jobs. Although this isnt a major issue it will have ripple effects for the area. Alot of the goods and resources received through the port go to the major cities nearby DC, Philly, Jersey, NYC.

Hi, this is Andrew Freedman, the Hedgeye analyst who published the short report referenced in the Bloomberg Article. Here is the summary of what we published. I'll be on here for the next hour or so. If you have any questions, let me know. I'll take the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-27/reddit-tumbles-as-hedgeye-names-it-a-short-idea-sees-50-slump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-27/reddit-tumbles-as-hedgeye-names-it-a-short-idea-sees-50-slump)

**Summary**

* **User Engagement**  

   * Despite its strengths, Reddit faces user interface complexity and navigation challenges, which can deter new users and limit mainstream adoption.
   * The platform's learning curve and unique culture might hinder broader audience segments.
   * Additionally, the emphasis on anonymity and community norms could hinder efforts to further personalize and enhance user experiences without infringing on privacy or community autonomy.
* **Monetization**  

   * Compared to other social media platforms, Reddit's advertising technology and capabilities are less mature, with limitations in targeting and measurement.
   * Advertisers may find the platform's effectiveness varying significantly across different verticals and campaign objectives.
   * The platform's core emphasis on user privacy and community integrity could constrain developing and adopting more advanced, intrusive ad technologies.
* **Data Licensing**  

   * While promising, the data licensing and AI segment is still nascent, with uncertainties around these initiatives' long-term value and scalability.
   * Reddit's commitment to user privacy and the ethical use of data may limit the scope of data monetization strategies, potentially capping the revenue potential from this segment (e.g., FTC launching inquiry into Reddit’s AI deals)
   * Diminishing marginal returns on data could present a risk to future contract renewals and pricing.
* **International Expansion**  

   * Reddit's content predominantly being in English and the platform's unique culture may pose challenges in replicating its success in international markets.
   * Achieving the necessary local relevance and community engagement will require substantial investment and might encounter varying degrees of success across different regions.
   * Reddit’s % of international users relative to other platforms is smaller. Therefore, making the international monetization gap less impressive.",2024-03-28 19:16:09,2024-03-28 19:16:09+00:00

It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you today that our beloved regard, Elongated Musko-raton, is going to be losing a lot of money. 

Why? Tesla isn't growing anymore. The verdict is in. Margins have compressed to near zero and all hopes and dreams have been pinned to a FSD Renaissance. It's the scenario everyone saw coming. 

Tesla is still pushing decent profits, so why does that matter? It matters because this company is valued for growth where there will likely be little if not eventual contraction. The average Nasdaq FWD p/e is about 30 and Tesla is sitting at about 60. It's only an eventuality this will be reconciled. 

The chart is setting up with another bear flag and will probably flush below 160 if Mr. Musk can't sell the market to speculate on future earnings growth via humanoid robots, AI taxis, and widespread adoption and legalization of FSD.

However, if you start hearing about Serbia in the news over the weekend or around April 18, come back to read this.

\-----

Yesterday (Mar 27, 2024), the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) [adopted a recommendation](https://x.com/PACE_News/status/1773013879242506521?s=20) to invite Kosovo to join the organization despite Serbia's strong opposition to the move.

Basically, Serbia has fought against international recognition of Kosovo and its membership in international bodies since Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in 2008, following a war over the territory.

Most of the 46 Council of Europe members have recognized Kosovo as a country.  
In fact, Kosovo has its own flag emoji: 🇽🇰

However, Serbia still regards Kosovo as part of its territory and has relied on China and Russia to challenge its sovereignty.

In an [interview](https://www.danas.rs/vesti/politika/uvek-smo-imali-slobodarski-stav-vucic-najavio-mogucnosti-da-srbija-izadje-iz-saveta-evrope/) with local broadcaster Prva TV, Serbian President [Aleksandar Vučić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vučić) mentioned that accepting Kosovo’s bid to join the organization “would de-facto mean kicking out Serbia.”

In response, Viola von Cramon-Taubadel--a German member of the European Parliament--considers Serbia's threat to be a [bluff](https://x.com/ViolavonCramon/status/1771426486400188901?s=20). And it might be.

However, Ana Brnabic--Serbian's Prime Minister--[fired back](https://x.com/anabrnabic/status/1771520607995236423?s=20).

>As for Serbia, dear... - we do not bluff. If the Council of Europe breaches its Statute and its values - truly no need to be part of that hypocrisy and charade. 👋👋

\-----

As I said before, this Balkan drama might lead to a nothing-burger.  
However, Kosovo's membership in the Council of Europe would [allow its citizens to sue Serbia for war crimes in the European Court of Human Rights](https://x.com/kos_data/status/1773382297850454299?s=20).

Furthermore, this is a [recent post](https://x.com/albinkurti/status/1770943735657800031?s=20) by the official account from the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosova:

>Days ago, Serbia's president issued an open threat: They are waiting for the best possible opportunity to invade 🇽🇰. Today, Serbian Army units have been detected just meters away from our border. We are closely monitoring the situation for any attempt to cross into 🇽🇰 territory.

Granted, the drone video from the border does not seem like an imminent invasion, but it shows this event is raising the temperature between both sides.

I researched the [Kosovo subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/rising/), but this doesn't seem to be on their radar.

However, Serbian President [Aleksandar Vučić](https://twitter.com/avucic) recently issued a grim statement about an unspecified threat to his country, [raising alarm bells](https://www.thedailybeast.com/serbian-presidents-alarming-social-media-warning-stirs-mystery-in-europe) about a possible geopolitical conflict.

>Difficult days are ahead of Serbia. At this moment, it is not easy to say what kind of news we have received in the last 48 hours, \[but\] they directly threaten our vital national interests, both of Serbia and \[Republika\] Srpska \[referring to the ethnically Serb Republika Srpska\].  
>  
>In the coming days, I will introduce the people of Serbia to all the challenges that lie ahead. It will be difficult. We will fight. Serbia will win.

While digging deeper, I found out the [White House had already noticed a large Serbian force along the Kosovo border](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-monitoring-large-serbian-force-along-kosovo-border-white-house-2023-09-29/). Also, some experts have claimed that Russia would benefit--and thus promote--a new conflict in Europe.

\-----

Personally, I bought some **VIX** calls, not just in case this news evolves over the long weekend but also because I'm gambling several hedge funds will offload positions into the new quarter.

As for this particular DD, there's no Kosovo or Serbia ETF.  
The only one I could find with some exposure is LEMB. That's the [iShares J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239528/ishares-emerging-markets-local-currency-bond-etf), which focuses on local currency-denominated government bonds issued by emerging market countries. However, Serbia only represents 4.47%.

I found no obvious, recognizable Kosovo-based or Serbia-based companies listed in the U.S. market.

According to the [U.S. Department of State](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-serbia), ""U.S. firms have invested around $4 billion in Serbia and employ more than 20,000 workers there.  Among the leading U.S. investors in the country are NCR, Philip Morris, Molson Coors, Ball Packaging, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Cooper Tire, Ametek, and Van Drunen Farms.""

I found no crucial export from either Kosovo or Serbia. I mean, nothing that truly stands out.

The only play I'm targeting (aside from my VIX gamble) is **ENLT**.

Why?  
Just yesterday:

>[Enlight Renewable Energy](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/27/2853039/0/en/EBRD-and-Erste-Approve-Financing-for-the-Pupin-Windfarm-in-Serbia.html) Ltd. closed on the financing of the Pupin wind farm project in Serbia

And there's another wrinkle.  
On Oct 2, 2023, ENLT announced they had secured PPA for the Pupin wind farm in Serbia.

>Under the PPA, the state-owned utility Elektroprivreda Srbije will purchase 72% of the project's output at a price of EUR 69 per MWh linked to Eurostat's Consumer Price Index.  
The remainder of the electricity produced will be sold on a merchant basis.  
>  
>With a total generation capacity of 94 megawatts, the Pupin project will cost USD$149-157 million, and is expected to generate revenues of USD$22-24 million and EBITDA of USD$13-15 million in its first full year of operation.  
>  
>Enlight has recently signed a binding agreement to acquire a 66% stake in the project from its partners, which is subject to approval by the Serbian regulator.  
>  
>The Company will own 100% of the project after completion of the acquisition.  
>  
>Pupin is expected to reach commercial operation in the second half of 2025.

Now, ENLT announced this as positive (bullish) news, yet look at what happened to their stock after that day. **She plunged -20% in six days.**

Therefore, I assume this Pupin project is an important catalyst for the company.

So far, I just bought some puts.  
If you decide to gamble along, I would recommend an expiration date beyond April 18 since that's the day when the PACE will vote on Kosovo's membership.

My Trail of Tears & Future Bitcoin Dreams,1,1bq51cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bq51cn/my_trail_of_tears_future_bitcoin_dreams/,1,1711655954.0,"Jumped off the deep end with a the classic *“trust me, bro”* vibe into Dogecoin at 0.07 cents, before it got its 15 minutes of fame with daddy Elon on SNL. It was a dive into the deep end of volatility, with gains vanishing like a mirage in the desert. That coupled with the meme stock frenzy had me gripping diamond hands on meme-stonks until I realized they were just cubic zirconia. Met a Bitcoin prophet who showed me the light, then at one point, I tried to outrun the market *with zero-day options on SPY-*  spoiler: I paper handed my bitcoin gains at 45k then crashed and burned with nothing to show for.

Now I'm waving goodbye to the high-stakes tables and choose to bet on the long game for Bitcoin. Doubling down on a comp-sci degree to actually contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem as a career I want to explore.

TL;DR - Rode the Dogecoin and meme stock wave straight into a wipeout. Swapped diamond hands for a crash course in humility and zero-day options. Now betting on a steady Bitcoin climb and leveling up with a comp-sci degree.

Go ahead, roast me if you wish.

Polestar (PSNY) delayed their earnings and are running out of cash,9,1bq5t4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bq5t4f/polestar_psny_delayed_their_earnings_and_are/,31,1711657779.0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aydxes/polestar_psny_should_beat_earnings_next_week_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

TLDR: I think Polestar has less cash than they are letting on, and could be approaching insolvency. July $1p are in play. 

The above link is my last DD on Polestar - a $3bn company. I thought they were going to have an awesome earnings report. After my DD, they went from $1.30 to $2.05ish, and are now trading at $1.60. Since then, a lot of red flags made me change my mind about their goodness:

1: they got $1bn in funding at the end of February(read: debt). This keeps them solvent a little longer
2: Polestar needs to submit audited financial statements this year, and it’s the first year this is in effect. ALL of their previous annual results were unaudited due to being a foreign Company. 🚩 
- the same day they released news on their funding, they also announced that they would be delaying financial reporting for FY23 (originally scheduled for Mid-March). 🚩 
- they still haven’t put out a date for their FY23 results. Further, there’s no projected date for their Q1 results. 🚩 

So here’s the tinfoil hat: I BELIEVE that their new CFO took one look at the financials, and went “NOPE.” Their financial team is in a spot where they have to verify all the numbers, and I bet they have a lot less cash on hand than we’ve been led to believe (and than they’ve told investors).

The delay in reporting financials is a HUGE RED FLAG.🚩 

Yeah, they got an extra $1bn of funding (which they estimated $1.3bn would keep them afloat through 2024). But if their actual cash position has been overstated, that line of credit gets pulled REALLY quick.

An event like this would be similar to what happened recently to a different company (let’s call them Fister) - they got funding, but still shut down their production line and have since been de-listed.

Sure, Polestar still makes quality cars, but that doesn’t mean they’re not also going broke.

Edit: PSNY files a form 20F (foreign issuer) - this is due within 6 months of the end of the FY - so 30 June is the due date for FY23 reporting.

It looks like a very long term trend slowing down. RSI indicates momentum. As you can see, it’s making lower highs as SPY makes higher highs. This means that the price is rising but with decreasing momentum. This usually marks the beginning of the reversal of a trend. 

Because this is a very high time frame chart, if the trend reverses, it’ll reverse for the next 3-5 years

Nobody really has a definitive answer on how this is possible because the moon isn’t supposed to be there. 

In fact, the only logical explanation for the moons carefully placed position is that it’s a spaceship. 

When NASA crashed something into the moon it rang like a bell for hours. 

When Buzz got up there it was like showing up to play for the Super Bowl.

When Stanley Kubrick filmed 2001: A Space Odyssey it was based on facts in 1968. Then he filmed Eyes Wide Shut and that was the end of that. 

With all the craziness going on in today’s world it doesn’t matter if it’s fake. What matters is we get to see the show every now and then.

Diamond Hands vs. SEC's $25k Day Trading Rule Cage Match,130,1bq9bfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bq9bfm/diamond_hands_vs_secs_25k_day_trading_rule_cage/,75,1711666483.0," Hey WSB Warriors, Diamond-Handed Day Traders, and YOLO Regards,

What do Gabelli v. SEC (2013) and Kokesh v. SEC (2017) have in common, you ask? Before your brain short-circuits and your Wife's boyfriend has to drive you to the hospital, let me lay it out for you. These aren't just any court cases; they're the epic tales of David slinging it hard at Goliath, the SEC, and actually managing to land a hit. These legal battles are the stuff of legend, where the mighty SEC got a taste of its own medicine, forced to backtrack and rethink its overzealous rules. It's like watching the Empire get outmaneuvered by a bunch of scrappy rebels. And guess what? We’re about to join the ranks of these legendary underdogs. 

Strap in and ignite those rocket engines; we’ve got a financial behemoth to slingshot around. The SEC, in its infinite ""wisdom,"" demands a king's ransom – a cool, casual $25,000 in your trading account – if you’ve got dreams of day trading your way to Valhalla. This rule isn’t just a high bar; it’s a slap across the face with a Gucci glove to anyone whose bank account doesn’t bleed gold. It's the aristocrats locking the castle gates, keeping us peasants from the lush fields of tendies and moon missions. Because, obviously, financial enlightenment is reserved for those who can swim in their cash like some cartoon duck, right?

**What’s Chafing Our Armor:**

Imagine telling Usain Bolt he’s benched because his spikes aren’t encrusted with diamonds. Sitting without $25k in your pocket? You're relegated to the kiddie table, watching your day trading dreams evaporate like my portfolio on a bad day (too soon?). It's like being told you can't join the race because you didn't show up in a Ferrari. Since when did the size of your war chest become more important than the sharpness of your strategy?

**The Legal Crusade:**

Twitter rants? Please, that's for amateurs. We’re marshaling our forces for a full-blown legal siege against the SEC, wielding the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment like Excalibur. Yeah, we're dragging the Constitution into this mudslinging fest. The PDT rule doesn’t just erect a barrier; it’s a veritable Berlin Wall designed to keep us commoners gazing longingly at the promised land of market movers and shakers. Last I checked, we were tearing down walls, not celebrating them. Walls are for people with something to hide, or something to lose. And guess what? That ain't us.

**Why You Can’t Sit This One Out:**

This isn’t about playing hot potato with stocks over your avocado toast. It’s the core of WallStreetBets – embracing the gamble, strategizing audacious moves, and proving that with a sharp mind (and sharper memes), even the little guy can give Wall Street a run for its money. We're here to make bank, not excuses, armed with nothing but our wits and an internet connection. This is about principle. It's about not letting the gilded gatekeepers of finance dictate who gets to ride the rocket and who doesn't. It's about tearing down the barriers to entry so every single one of us has a shot at the stars.

**Sound the Horns:**

Time to sharpen your swords and rally to the banner:

1. **Chronicle Your Battles**: Got a saga where the $25k rule clipped your wings? Spill. Flood the sub, scream it into the social void. Your war story could be the rallying cry we need. Let's turn our collective grumbles into a thunderous roar that shakes the very foundations of their ivory towers.
2. **Awaken the Horde**: This isn't just a WSB skirmish. It's a clarion call to every corner of the net. Memes, tweets, TikToks – let loose your arsenal. Stoke the fires, make the SEC feel our heat. Let's make this the stuff of legend, a tale so wildly viral that not a soul on the internet can ignore our call to arms.
3. **Amass the War Chest**: Girding for legal battle? We’ll need a dragon’s hoard. Thinking of launching a war fund – because apparently, justice and top-tier lawyers don’t come cheap. Every penny counts; let's pool our resources and armor up for the long haul. This is our Spartacus moment, our time to rise up together and fight for our right to trade.
4. **Ink Your Allegiance**: Watch for our petition like a hawk. Your John Hancock is your war cry. Let’s show the SEC they’ve awoken a sleeping giant. Signatures are our war paint; let's cover ourselves in the colors of rebellion and march united into battle.
5. **Sharpen Minds and Swords**: Arm yourself with the facts. Dive deep, spread the word, and enlist others. Our strength is in our numbers and our unbreakable resolve. This isn’t just about knowledge; it’s about forging an army so informed, so passionate, that we become an unstoppable force of market democracy.

To the moon, my intrepid adventurers. This is more than history in the making; it’s rewriting the playbook. The SEC might clutch their regulations like pearls, but we wield the unstoppable force of the masses... and an endless quiver of memes.
