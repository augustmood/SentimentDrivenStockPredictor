Biden using Strategic Petroleum Reserves to Hide Inflation (Part 2),19,1br64s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br64s9/biden_using_strategic_petroleum_reserves_to_hide/,420,1711763751.0,"I made a post 5 months ago, asking if Biden releasing the SPR to hide the runaway inflation. I think now we have a definite answer, yes.

The U.S. is producing record amounts of crude oil
Since 2018. While Biden released almost 300k since 2021. I'm sure some of you are ""so what""ing me. So the Fed has claimed we are seeing prices fall, inflation decreasing or at least inflation heading in the right direction. You know what those number would hinge greatly on? The price of oil. Everything requires oil, everything. Biden is controlling the oil supply artificially high to prevent further increases to inflation numbers. Biden is not going to resupply the SPR in any legitimate sense as it would greatly increase the price of oil as seen in recent news. The purchase of 24.7mn of oil sent prices up by $2.00 a barrel dispite record production. Biden and his team are running out of ideas to keep a cap on inflation during the election cycle. If the Fed lowers interest rate to temporarily grow the U.S. economy, we have even clearer answers that the only thing that matters is the election. The next president, who ever it is Harris, Trump, or Stein, it won't matter, they will have limited abilities to stop an inflationary recession.

***Why does AI matter to Ford?***

* **Innovative Technology Integration**: Latitude AI will offer innovative technological solutions that could enhance Ford's product offerings. This includes advancements in autonomous driving technology, vehicle connectivity, or manufacturing efficiency.
* **Competitive Advantage**: If Latitude AI provides Ford with a competitive edge in the automotive industry, it could help Ford maintain or increase its market share. Cutting-edge technology can differentiate Ford from its competitors and attract customers.
* **Future Growth Potential**: Investing in companies that embrace emerging technologies like AI can be advantageous for long-term growth. If Latitude AI positions Ford to capitalize on future trends in the automotive industry, it could result in sustained growth and shareholder value appreciation.
* **Diversification and Risk Management**: Incorporating innovative technologies like AI into its operations can help Ford diversify its revenue streams and mitigate risks associated with traditional automotive manufacturing. This diversification could make Ford more resilient to economic downturns or industry disruptions **LIKE THE ONE ALL YOU APES HAVE BEEN CLAIMING IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS.**

April's Earnings Predictions,17,1br9hk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br9hk6/aprils_earnings_predictions/,22,1711774252.0,"Some of you may know me from my AI stock predictions google sheet post. Some of you may not. Either way, here are my prediction looking ahead at April.  
Looking ahead at next earnings season, there are many stocks with a focus on AI that have earnings that I think are ready to make BIG moves. The sheet identifies a few of these tickers including, but not limited to: MSFT, META, INTC, AAPL, AMD, NVDA, MU, and AMZN. Others that have less relevance to AI but are predicted to make moves during earnings are TSLA, NFLX, and SNOW.   
For reference, this sheet is a predictive model with a perfect accuracy rate when it comes to predicting trends in a stock after earnings and a high accuracy rate in predicting precise percentage jumps or dumps. For those of you that may have low credibility in this statement and following statements, note that when I originally introduced it to WSB on Thursday morning, one user requested I predict the results of SMTC after earnings. The result, which came less than two hours after the request, was the model was off by less than 1.5%!   
Now for predictions. The largest movers with high AI relevance in April are are MSFT (Earnings on 4/23) , META (4/24), AMZN (4/25), & INTC (4/25). Each have a respective prediction of 14.29%, 27.63%, 10.83%, and 1.83%. Important to note: these jumps predict the percent change in the stock price from earnings to 24 hours post. Also, these prediction are subject to change as earnings approach. Even though they are not directly related to the AI race, TSLA (4/17) is predicted to jump 4.20% at earnings and NFLX (4/18) 11.46% especially if it reports a likely increase in subscribers.  
Please let me know your thoughts on these prediction and whether you agree or not. FYI, there are more stocks on the spreadsheet  I left out as their market caps that may be too small to post on WSB. If you are interested in viewing the sheet please let me know. If you are interested in viewing the sheet, DM me.",2024-03-30 04:50:52,2024-03-30 04:50:52+00:00

**Ouster Inc DCF**

This is using a conservative interpretation of analyst forecasts and their new long-term financial framework, which aims for:

* 30-50% revenue growth
* 35-40% GM (already achieved)
* Opex remaining at current levels ($120M a year but I adjusted for rising inflation)

Importantly, this does **not** account for other factors like Hesai being blacklisted, which should be very beneficial for OUST.

EBITDA ($M)                        (55)             (38)            (5)           35                 75

Unlevered Cash Flow ($M)              (28)             (28)         (13)          24                   44

Present value of 2024-2028 Free cash flow is -$1m, Present value of terminal value is $132m at 2% perpetual growth. At current net cash of $140m, this equates to **$5.96** per share.

This valuation uses a WACC (weighted average cost of capital) of **17.9%**, comprising a 23.9% cost of equity and 6.0% after-tax cost of debt. If you were to run a sensitivity analysis, you would find the largest driver of Ouster's high WACC is:

* Its extremely high beta (2.50)
* Its small size, which increases its premium by at least 2-3%

Given that positive operating performance would self-correct both of these, I calculated a WACC using:

* A lower beta of 1.50 (not uncommon for a speculative small cap and around the level of Luminar (LAZR)
* Removed the size premium which would come with even a modest uplift to $500m (2.8x 25E sales)

Changing just these two variables reduces the WACC down to **11.5%**, pushing the NPV up to **$9.86** per share. Ouster seems to have traded within the range of $5-9 for much of the last year, however with $200m of cash against an expected $85m cash burn until breakeven, I see no solvency risk. Ouster's valuation now rests purely on the execution of its strategy, which if successful, should lead to considerable gains for shareholders from present levels.

That info is pre 4 quarter earnings.

Bullish or Bearish Powell Interview?,104,1brl1oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brl1oj/bullish_or_bearish_powell_interview/,110,1711813937.0,"I have seen a pretty equal amount of people making the case that Powell's recent interview was bullish or bearish. I have decided to lay out the cases for both.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that PCE numbers were released a few hours before the interview. The numbers were in line with what was expected, with MoM PCE below expectations.

Disclaimer: I saw Powell's comments as more dovish than hawkish, but I will try to lay out both cases as unbiasedly as possible.

**Bullish perspective:**

The PCE numbers were a positive, in spite of a slight uptick, because they were what economists were expecting. Powell even alluded to that in the beginning of the interview, saying ""It is good to see something coming in line with expectations"" and ""It's definitely more along the lines of what we want to see"". He also mentioned a few times how inflation has been coming down and there has been real progress made.

At one point during the interview, the interviewer (who, by the way, was extremely brash) asked why would it be terrible to initially lower the rates before data provides confidence and react appropriately if the data changes. To which Powell said ""you're right, we always have to be humble,..The outlook is always much more uncertain than most people think"". He went on to say they (the Fed) are in a good place to react to a range of scenarios, with the bear case being holding rates where they are and the base case of lowering rates.

Moreover, after the PCE release and interview, interest rate traders increased the odds of a June rate cut to ~60% from ~50% on Thursday.


**Bearish:**

Powell brought up the high inflation readings from January and alluded to them being concerning. He mentioned how they expect to see inflation coming down on bumpy path 

Powell also addressed the elephant in the room about when it is appropriate to begin lowering rates. He said ""we don't see it as likely to be appropriate to begin reducing interest rate until we are confident that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustained basis"". He reiterated multiple times that they are not in a hurry to lower rates. The reasoning behind this is that the economy is strong and unemployment is near historic lows. The case being made from bears is that this is a bad thing because it gives justification to the Fed to just keep rates where they are.

Lastly, Powell said that he does not see rates going back to their pre-pandemic low.


**Why I am leaning bullish:**

I don't think the markets expected Powell to cut rates in May anyways. So there was no expectation to rush into a rate cut. Also, I don't believe markets expected rates to go back to those below 1% pre pandemic lows.

My takeaway was that the worst case scenario is rates stay where they are for longer than expected, where best case scenario is they come down significantly. But even in that worst case scenario, it only happens because the economy is booming and unemployment stays low, so is it really worst case? Even in this worst case scenario, Powell alluded that eventually they would lower rates when inflation does come down. So there is no case where rates remain where they are indefinitely.

TLDR: Bulls have a point, bears have a point, and I identify as a heterosexual bull (he/him pronouns).

LLY has been fucking pumping for good reason in the past few months. 

1. They have insane revenue. They beat last earnings expectations from exp: 8.97 billion to act: 9.35 billion. Thats a whole lot of money to be bringing in constantly. And they have an expected revenue for next quarter at 8.98 billion. LIKE WHAT TF. 

2. They legit cannot make enough products to meet demand. Obesity and diabetes have swept the country and health related problems that LLY capitalize on have spiked and almost half of Americans are over weight and will soon need these drugs. Idk if you may have read that correctly. ALMOST HALF OF AMERICANS ARE OVERWEIGHT, many also have diabetes which is also another area for lly to make money. 

3. Weight loss drugs are the temporary solution to this shitty problem. People will take the temporary solution any day of the week. And in this case the temporary solution is LLY weight loss drugs. 

This is a powerhouse of a company with great financials and calls are definitely the play since earnings are later in April. You wouldn’t even need to hold through earnings to get profits. Since people will wake up and pump LLY since people see the earnings are close.

My chart in day and swing trading,28,1bruuf4,https://i.redd.it/994sudznwjrc1.jpeg,26,1711839146.0,"Two years ago I uploaded trade republic and started trading, back then I just knew the basics and though along the way I will learn more. I used to trade mostly in tesla stock and options. 

So my idea or my “strategy” back then, is to take a stock that has high volatility and day trade it, I noticed pattern that the stock go up  end of the day so I sell then, and when it would not work out I will just wait couple of days and then sell (you can see in the charts that when i sell after days its low profit but still no loss). 

Other thing is, when I though the stock is going down I would sell fast in order to minimise the loss (thats why I have that one loss or less than 1% profit). 

Now, I look at the chart and its looks good, what do you think of this strategy? And do you think it was all just luck ? or am i on the right path? All i focus on in trading is risk management and not let my ego and emotions take over which i feel i kinda did a good job. 

After a while I stopped trading because i had to move countries, but planning to start trade again! ",2024-03-30 22:52:26,2024-03-30 22:52:26+00:00

I was reading the below article, and decided to give Brookfield Infrastrucure Partners a second look:

https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/24/a-once-in-a-generation-investment-opportunity-1-ai/

Some things I like:

Based on the current shareprice, dividend of 5.19%

Trading around the low end of its 52-week average

AI datacenter play

24.29% YoY revenue growth in 2023

Free Cash Flow of $1.75 billion

67% institutional ownership

$38 - 40 target price

For those in the sub following $BIP, curious to hear your takes, whether for the Bull or Bear case.

Currently hold 114 shares at an average cost of $30.53 a share. Seems to be finally trending back up over the past month, and seems poised to break the 6 month resistance level that's around $32.",2024-03-30 23:01:15,2024-03-30 23:01:15+00:00
TSM Earnings Play,508,1brv5tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brv5tx/tsm_earnings_play/,347,1711839972.0,"TSM is going to smash their earnings and I base that on the actual numbers TSM is putting out. Unlike most companies TSM releases their revenues monthly on their investors relations website:

https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024

There revenues so far for this quarter are 397,433 (M) NT.

If we look at previous March performances, its a slower month for them. Last year they posted approxinately $150,000 (M) NT. 

There YOY growth in revenues for the two previous months have been 7.9 and 11.3%. Since I like easy math, let's say that had 10% YOY for March.

Their revenue for this march would come in at 165,000 (M) NT.


The total revenue would be 562,433 (M) NT. Converting that to USD from NT. We would have revenue of 17435 (M) USD. 

There profitability is typically between 40 and 42%, so on the lower end. Profit would be 6974 (M) USD.

Since there are 4.65 Billion shares outstanding, we could potentially see an EPS $1.49-1.5.

That's a huge beat and potentially a solid rally to follow.

This is not financial advice. Am bullish on TSM.",2024-03-30 23:06:12,2024-03-30 23:06:12+00:00
