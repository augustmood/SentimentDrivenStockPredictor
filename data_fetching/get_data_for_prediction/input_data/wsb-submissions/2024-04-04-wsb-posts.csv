SPY - I did a thing on a chart. sell off come June 2024,0,1bv9tfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bv9tfc/spy_i_did_a_thing_on_a_chart_sell_off_come_june/,2,1712191929.0,"I too do a bit of trading and sharting myself. 

[SPY chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IZBmWF3k/)

Heres a spy chart. I think we rally or trade flat until about june (fed meeting. it has stars on it, so it must be important). I'm anticipating a sell off from this point to around $500. Before that I think 530 to 560 is a reasonable target however, we could just trade in a range from 520 to 560 before getting to that news. 

Catalysts - Obviously everyone is still focused on rate cut/hikes, so I imagine this will be a player in moving the markets up/down/sideways. 

rate cut - bullish

rate same - should be mid term negative so the market should trade flat and gradually go down as the rate continues to degrade the economy and you see unemployment start to ramp up and stay.

rate hike - quick sell off.

Bets - 

over next 18 months - we end up at 475 - 500 +/- (lower bound to 450 to 460) . In the meantime, you could have a rally so take advantage of that cautiously (take profits and reduce your risk where you're over exposed).

Moves: Probably just buy to downside spy and hedge with calls,

Is Canada Goose preparing to sell?,0,1bv9tvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bv9tvk/is_canada_goose_preparing_to_sell/,17,1712191963.0,"Hear me out‚Ä¶So Canada Goose recently cut 17% of their total workforce. This is the second cut in less than a year (last cut August 2023)

They have impressive YoY revenue growth from an increase in store count, strong sales from existing locations, high direct to consumer growth (including online sales). Goose‚Äôs revenue performance in Asia Pacific is wild compared to North America which is also doing great. All this leads me to believe they are VERY UNDERVALUED. 

Goose has an aggressive growth objective of $3 Billion in sales by 2028. Their forward P/E ratio as of today is 9.54 and without NRI 16.16. If you look at LVMH and Hermes forward P/E, they trade at 25.55 and 52.36 as of today. Gooses current market cap is now $1.52 billion (down from $2 billion). They could easily be purchased by one of the big boys (notice LVMH doesn‚Äôt have an outdoor brand). I also learned that Goose may have axed their new travel retail program (opening stores in airports) which was launched last year. Furthermore I‚Äôm seeing Bain Capital leaders being injected into Sr Management for ex: Beth Clymer who was brought in last year as President of Finance, Culture/People, Strategy and Legal (which is a really weird combination of departments under one person). Bain Capital is also their biggest shareholder where she was EVP  and her title still says Private Equity Operating Partner. They‚Äôve hired BCG to oversee a transformation and seems like they‚Äôre about to rebrand given their new product lines.

CONCLUSION:
They have consistent and strong sales growth, expansion plans, bolstered leadership, diversifying their product line (shoes, hats, summer and spring wear etc) and IMO they trade at a major discount. These cuts are telling me they are shedding the fat and maybe preparing for a sale. 

I could be dead WRONG and people in here might shred my ass for it lol. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have a look and tell me what you think‚Ä¶",2024-04-04 00:52:43,2024-04-04 00:52:43+00:00

It‚Äôs not too late to capitalize on the $LUNR bull run about to occur!,12,1bvc4we,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bvc4we,70,1712198357.0,"Here is a full rundown of what is going on with $LUNR now that I have all the information.

Originally this was thought to be a 1-5 million dollar deal by nasa to outsource a company to make their moon car.
Now we know that the initial announcement of LUNR as one of the winners comes with a large 30 million dollar check to LUNR along with up to 4.6 billion dollars in potential rewards by producing results.
Along with this massive gain for the young company who is now massively undervalued, they are the only publicly traded company involved in this mission which will be the most important space news since the moon landing.

This hasn‚Äôt hit big media on wallstreet yet and a total of 2 articles are out causing this to be a very odd buying opportunity that does not often present itself.

If you can catch an order immediately at 7:00 AM tomorrow you have a feasible opportunity to bask in the same bull run gains as the early birds.

I am not a financial advisor however I believe this stock will pump to an absolute minimum price of 11$ potentially to 40 or 50 if the news goes high enough. Then it will probably stay high but dump a little and won‚Äôt go crazy again until the next news comes out, potentially the first mission.

Another driving force for price is that over 30% of the total shares are shorted, meaning those people will have to buy back their shares to close out short positions further adding to the well times insanity.",2024-04-04 02:39:17,2024-04-04 02:39:17+00:00

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) finally pulled back to my $440 entry point today.  I am all in with 50 Jan 25 options at $480 strike (bought as ULTA hit my trigger).

NOTE: Given the big run up today, I cashed out today as ULTA hit 460.  If it pulls back down, I will be buying again, but it was prudent to take my profit today. Looking at the chart - the stock has done this a few times, where it will have a dead cat bounce, then more selling pressure, and ultimately recovery.  

While the market puked on the CEO's early soft guidance preview, I think this 15% haircut is an overreaction. A 5% slip? Sure. But a full-blown 15% beatdown? That's an opportunity.

üí∞ Best-in-class loyalty program driving stickier customer base and superior data

üíÑ Unique positioning as the only major player straddling prestige and mass beauty in an accessible way

üíØ Exceptionally well-run company that consistently executes year after year

While it may take until next earnings for ULTA to fully recover from this guidance-driven gut punch, I'm very confident the long-term fundamental story remains intact. The selloff has created a gift in one of retail's highest-quality franchises.

Still, there are going to be delays as they return to full production.

This slight delay may actually be beneficial to them as supply-demand drive prices for chips higher especially with the huge demand for NVDIA's new Blackwell processors with AI bubble in full swing. 

With TSMC monthly revenue set to be published on the 10 Apr, most likely going to show yoy growth and earning on the 18 Apr where I doubt they will give a weak outlook for the year due to the crazy demand for AI processors; I think TSMC is gonna üöÄüöÄ. They are the major chip suppliers for NVDA and I don't think it will slow down, and this slight slowdown in production due to the earthquake will only increase profits (they are in the Goldilock zone of disasters).

Earthquake in Taiwan may increase profitability for chipmakers,30,1bvgi4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvgi4c/earthquake_in_taiwan_may_increase_profitability/,25,1712213078.0,"TSMC seems to have come out pretty much unscathed from the earthquake except for slight damage to some equipment. Still, there are going to be delays as they return to full production.

This slight delay may actually be beneficial to them as supply-demand drive prices for chips higher especially with the huge demand for NVDIA's new Blackwell processors with the AI bubble in full swing.

With TSMC monthly revenue set to be published on the 10 Apr, most likely going to show yoy growth and earning on the 18 Apr where I doubt they will give a weak outlook for the year due to the crazy demand for AI processors; I think TSMC is gonna üöÄüöÄ. They are the major chip suppliers for NVDA and I don't think it will slow down, and this slight slowdown in production due to the earthquake will only increase profits (they are in the Goldilock zone of disasters).

Entain Stock Primed for Growth,0,1bvlf8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvlf8l/entain_stock_primed_for_growth/,3,1712232325.0,"Dear Forum Members,

Today, I want to highlight the compelling case for investing in Entain stock (LSE: ENT) and why it holds significant potential for substantial growth in the near future.

Entain‚Äôs presence in the European market is poised to receive a significant boost this year, thanks to two major sporting events: the UEFA European Football Championship and the Olympic Games. These events command massive attention across Europe, translating into a surge in sports betting activity. Entain, with its substantial market share in Europe, is well-positioned to capitalize on this increased demand for betting services. With sports events gradually returning to their regular schedule, we can anticipate a surge in revenue for Entain, as it leverages its stronghold in the sports betting sector.

Moreover, let‚Äôs delve into the low price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of Entain, which stands at just 12.62 for 2025, according to Finanzen.net. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued relative to its earnings, making it an attractive investment opportunity. As investors, this presents an opportunity to acquire Entain shares at a relatively low valuation, with the potential for significant upside as the company continues to grow its revenue and profitability.

Another aspect worth considering is the growth potential of Entain‚Äôs subsidiary, BetMGM, in the burgeoning U.S. sports betting market. With the gradual liberalization of sports betting regulations across various states in the U.S., BetMGM stands to benefit significantly. The company has been making strategic investments and partnerships to strengthen its position in this lucrative market, positioning itself as a key player poised for substantial growth in the coming years. In February BetMGM signed an exclusive Betting Partnership with X, which will lead to further growth in the US in near-term. 

Furthermore, there's speculation surrounding a potential reacquisition of Entain by MGM Resorts International, driven by the current low stock price of Entain. This lower valuation might prompt Entain to consider strategic options to create value for its shareholders. One such option could involve selling its 50% stake in BetMGM, as Entain might feel pressured to enhance shareholder value amidst the low stock price. This scenario adds an intriguing dimension to Entain's stock outlook, as it navigates the possibility of strategic moves to unlock shareholder value amidst changing market dynamics. While these possibilities remain speculative, they underscore the importance of monitoring Entain's strategic decisions in light of its current valuation and market conditions.

In conclusion, Entain‚Äôs stock presents a compelling investment opportunity, supported by factors such as its strong position in the European market, low price-to-earnings ratio, growth prospects in the U.S. through BetMGM, and the possibility of a strategic acquisition by MGM Resorts International.

I welcome your thoughts and further discussion on this investment opportunity.",2024-04-04 12:05:25,2024-04-04 12:05:25+00:00
EQT - room to run?,0,1bvm1ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvm1ma/eqt_room_to_run/,7,1712234218.0,"I had EQT on my radar after they announced plans to reacquire the pipeline company they previously spun off. The market initially didn't like the deal, sending EQT's stock tumbling - creating an undervalued opportunity that I pounced on around $34.

However, after taking a nice profit by exiting my position in the $36.80s, EQT has continued grinding higher, now stabilizing north of $37. A few factors seem to be pressuring the stock - excess natural gas supply, Biden's unfavorable energy policies, and an overall tough market backdrop for the sector.

That said, with EQT appearing to find its footing, I suspect the rebound could continue towards the $45 level. For now, I'm staying on the sidelines to watch the price action play out. But I may re-establish a position if we get another dip towards $36, although that may not materialize for a while.

The energy trade remains volatile, but EQT's beaten down levels presented an attractive risk/reward, especially as it hasn't run up compared to its other energy peers (of course given nat gas has continued to be depressed). ",2024-04-04 12:36:58,2024-04-04 12:36:58+00:00

LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

‚ÄúThe transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,‚Äù said Tom Werner, President and CEO. ‚ÄúThe ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition‚Äôs effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.‚Äù

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240404698637/en/Lamb-Weston-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Updates-Fiscal-Year-2024-Outlook

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company‚Äôs fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.

"DD: ""ADEA"", a sleeping giant chip designer currently toying with the big dogs.",523,1bvpxr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvpxr3/dd_adea_a_sleeping_giant_chip_designer_currently/,230,1712244176.0,"Hello, fellow regards. I'm going to be completely transparent here... I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  


The potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...

Here are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:

‚Äã

# Report 1 (Financials) 

Adeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.

Financially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).

The valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia‚Äôs trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.

On the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.

Given its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.

# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) 

Based on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.

Adeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures. This innovation is being increasingly adopted in sensors, memory chips, and logic devices due to its potential to enhance performance and functionality while simultaneously reducing size and costs‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

Adeia's hybrid bonding technology stands as a testament to the company's long-standing commitment to advancing the semiconductor industry. Over the past 30 years, Adeia has made fundamental advances in the field, holding an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that covers not just hybrid bonding but also advanced process nodes and packaging technologies‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã. This latest development underscores Adeia's role in driving innovation in semiconductor technologies, which could have broad implications for the industry's future.",2024-04-04 15:22:56,2024-04-04 15:22:56+00:00
$GES - The mechanics of special dividend induced covering and why this is now looking even more promising,7,1bvqibb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvqibb/ges_the_mechanics_of_special_dividend_induced/,8,1712245511.0,"Alright, you gambling addicted regards. Like many of you, I saw the DD on $GES posted a few days ago and thought to myself‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis is probably bullshit, but I‚Äôll take a nibble just in case‚Äù. The next day or so, the stock pumped but then gave back gains as everyone with the attention span of a goldfish lost interest and went to chase the next shiny toy. I understand. I‚Äôve done the same thing plenty of times. But, I had a feeling in my plums about this $GES DD, so I decided to dig a little deeper and understand how this is going to play out. Nothing against the original DD, but I‚Äôm not sure it explained things exactly. So sit back, lube up and enjoy:

**The heart of this play - the special dividend and its impact on short sellers:**

The company has announced a special dividend of $2.40 per share. This means that each shareholder will receive an additional $2.40 for every share they own. However, to be eligible to receive this special dividend, investors must own the stock before the **ex-dividend date**, which in this case is April 16th.

**Impact on Short Sellers:** As we all know, $GES is heavily shorted at 27% of the float. Shorts will now owe the special dividend payment to the original owner of the shares they borrowed, but they don't receive any dividend payments themselves because they are technically borrowing the shares.

**Forced to Pay Dividend:** The shorts need to cover or **pay the dividend on the ex-dividend date of April 16th**. To cover the special dividend payment owed to the original shareholder, short sellers must buy back shares of the stock. However, buying back shares increases demand for the stock, which can drive up the stock price. As the stock price rises, short sellers face increasing losses and pressure to exit their short positions by buying back shares at higher prices.

**The Play - The Week of Ex-Div Date:** The combination of the special dividend repayment, positive earnings report, and the company's repurchasing program (200m) can create a perfect storm for shorts. As they rush to buy back shares to cover their positions and pay the special dividend, the increased demand for the stock can trigger a good old fashioned squeeze.

**Added Fuel:** Since the original DD was posted on $GES, the options chain has begun to accumulate open interest. As you can imagine, higher open interest sits at strikes that are slightly OTM. If these strikes go in the money, which they would in the event of a squeeze, then this move could be truly explosive.

**Current Gamma Ramp on 4/19 Chain:** 32C - 763 OI, 33C - 1,754 OI, 34C - 3,733 OI, 35C - 6,266 OI, 36C - 3,514 OI

As the OP of the original DD put it - A stock shorted this heavily isn't supposed to have the cash flow to issue a large special dividend nor do buybacks. They're supposed to be going out of business in the foreseeable future. That is anything but the truth with $GES, so I think this one is shaping up well for the coming few weeks.

My position: 400 35C for 4/19. The stock only needs to go roughly 11 percent for these to go in the money and if the special dividend play goes as expected, then I don't think that should be a problem. If it doesn't go as expected, well then I get blown out and nobody is surprised. Position photo in comments.",2024-04-04 15:45:11,2024-04-04 15:45:11+00:00

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let‚Äôs start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn‚Äôt matter much towards the end. But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They‚Äôre all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape

So Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you‚Äôre underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA‚Äôs tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they‚Äôll get it if they approve.

## Altria‚Äôs On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor

In case you didn‚Äôt know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they‚Äôre expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

One of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù. They know smoking rates are declining so they‚Äôre repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That‚Äôs why Morningstar says they‚Äôre worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it‚Äôs a value stock.

## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they‚Äôre out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we‚Äôll be eating tendies and banging their wives.

Maybe they think it's worth more? *But, from the initial pop to $108, we see that the market thinks in an acquisition, it could roughly be worth at least much.* So why do I think an acquisition is coming?

**Setup for Acquisition**

1. The company is not going to be able to commercialize the drug itself. They've never brought a drug to market and they don't have the infrastructure in place to do so themselves. It just makes no sense at all. So to my mind, they are waiting out for a better offer.
2. In my view, recent trading patterns have shown a high likelihood that an activist investor is purchasing a large stake. The reason they would do this is to compel management to accept an offer (perhaps a lower one than they are holding out for) sooner rather than later. This way, maybe the sale isn't perfectly optimized, but everyone gets $$$. 

**Why do I say that?**

There was a $50 MILLION purchase towards EOD last week. **This is a massive block trade.** Check out the huge candle and then a few following candles. And yes, I use TDA for data viz not robinhood.

[There's been a few of these mega buys](https://preview.redd.it/nbdh68ywthsc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c502cd0a41220baa4bcdbc856286b23712cfd436)

This came out the same day that M&A reporter Betaville said that Eli Lily was interested in taking over the company. Now, I don't normally put much stock in rumors, but in this case I looked back and found that this reporter **was also the** ***first*** **to report that $CYTK was a takeover target**, way back in 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/v8fz7xzluhsc1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=888a9a561ad9a149e19a9e71038abbc1943683f2

I dove into their track record and it's pretty mixed, so take all of that with a heap of salt. But anyways, here's why I am long calls. There are multiple ways to win:

1. Buyout is announced
2. Stock trades up on anticipation of a buyout into earnings on 5/8
3. Activist investor involvement is announced, indicating to the market that mgmt will be more likely to sell quick
4. XBI continues on its run and it trades up in sympathy

**Risk factors**

The drug is good and has good data, and there's clear acquirer interest. The initial report was from a pretty reputable source, Reuters. So clearly this is an attractive asset. But there is still many risks to consider:

1. Hard to get good fills on options
2. No way to know when a buyout would come
3. No way to know IF a buyout would come‚Äîmanagement may (stupidly imo) try to go it alone
4. Competing data could come out and be better, killing the story
5. Mixed track record of M&A reporters indicates they might not really have insight

There's a ton more risks and you really need to do your own DD. This is a binary bet so it's super risky. As I've said before, despite being right about DJT on the first day trading (haha) I am an absolute idiot. Do not yolo or follow blindly.

Now, I bought these a week or so after Aunty Nan disclosed her 200C Jan‚Äô25 leaps (on the way up from the bottom after earnings and her second buy). Why? Because she‚Äôs the fucking _Queen of insider trading_ would be why. 

Now regards will question whether she burned a couple mill to keep the hounds off her tracks and not go too overboard with timely gains. Pulled a Roblox if you will.

I say no though. Here‚Äôs why:

1. Election year, heightened focus on cybersecurity given what happened the last time Trump ran with Russia and China dicking around. Also several attacks recently (AT&T, healthcare, water systems). And, White House had a bunch of cybersecurity briefings when she bought ‚Äòem at the beginning of the year.

2. Would she risk fucking over any potential voters whatsoever of her party given how closely her trades are tracked and seemingly followed? Now, I‚Äôm fully conscious this could just be regarded copium, but idk, don‚Äôt think Biden‚Äôs in a place to be affording any risks right now.

Embracer Group - Swedish stock,31,1bvt38x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvt38x/embracer_group_swedish_stock/,33,1712251575.0,"Embracer Group, a prominent player in the gaming industry, has recently experienced a significant downturn in its stock price. However, there are signs of a recovery underway as positive news continues to emerge, bolstering investor confidence and attracting attention from financial institutions.

Despite its recent struggles, Embracer Group's stock has garnered interest from banks and investors alike. This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.

One notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.

As Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.

$CVNA: Sky-High Valuation Is a House of Cards,13,1bvt7yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvt7yg/cvna_skyhigh_valuation_is_a_house_of_cards/,17,1712251887.0,"Carvana (CVNA) is significantly overvalued, with a strong case for an imminent decline in share price.

**Unsustainable Valuation:** Carvana's valuation at $19 billion, representing a 49x EV/2024E EBITDA multiple, is deemed absurd and unsustainable, especially given the company's mixed 4Q23 results and underwhelming growth outlook. This valuation places Carvana at a premium not just relative to auto dealers but also leading tech companies, despite lacking comparable growth prospects or profitability. To reach the current stock price, it's not just necessary for EBITDA per unit to double, but also for vehicle sales and revenue to increase at an improbable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over a period of seven years.

**Profitability and Growth Concerns:** Despite efforts to improve profitability to mitigate balance sheet crises, Carvana's growth is challenged. The anticipation for a return to meaningful growth is contradicted by a mere ""slight"" unit growth projection for 1Q24, signaling that profitability enhancements may be nearing their limits.

**Comparison with CarMax:** Carvana's operational metrics, particularly gross profit per retail unit (GPU), have plateaued, reaching levels consistent with CarMax but without exhibiting any remarkable edge over the industry leader. This comparison undermines Carvana's positioning as a disruptor in the auto retail sector. As former Carvana executives said, the company is ""just a dealership. 

**Operational Inefficiencies and Market Misconceptions:** Carvana's operational efficiencies and market positioning, suggesting that the company's past growth was achieved by overlooking fundamental industry practices rather than through disruptive innovation. Carvana's improvement strategies, especially in vehicle reconditioning and logistics, largely mimic those of CarMax, challenging the narrative of Carvana as a unique tech-driven entity. 

https://preview.redd.it/vtteaoejzhsc1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8ca0efff42b5bfd2694fc37bb9a7a492443fa6b

**Growth Versus Profitability Dilemma:** Carvana faces a dilemma between pursuing aggressive growth and maintaining profitability. The operational and strategic shifts required for growth could compromise the company's recent profitability achievements, a risk exacerbated by the tight job market and supply constraints in the used vehicle sector.

**Valuation and Price Target:** The price target of $16, a 77% decline from current levels, is based on a 12x multiple to their estimated 2026E EBITDA, aligning Carvana's valuation more closely with CarMax and reflecting the operational and financial realities facing Carvana.

Many market participants were expecting a miss in the Q1 deliveries (remember that guy who posted here about the six millionth vehicle produced? A figure that implied the Q1 estimates would not be hit, estimates that had already been revised down). Because of that, many market participants loaded up on puts before Tuesday, and sold to close between Tuesday and today. So the delta-neutral Market Makers started closing their short positions (that they had opened to hedge) as the puts were being sold by the options buyers, resulting in the price action that we witnessed since Tuesday and which culminated in today's ""unexpected"" move. The grindy short covering between 10am and 11:40 also left many day traders trapped (who kept selling short as the stock moved upwards), which further contributed to that mini-squeeze.

If you had shorted the stock, congratulations.  If you are long, read on.

Reality is these were excuses.  This is a risk off play, but also a move away from non-value that AMD represents at the current buy price.  AMD's been going higher surrounding its potential to produce groundbreaking AI chips. However, this optimism appears to be misplaced for a few reasons. Firstly, AMD's so-called AI chips have not been widely adopted by users, casting doubt on their significance. Secondly, even if AMD manages to make notable strides in AI, NVIDIA could simply respond by lowering prices, nullifying AMD's potential advantage.

On the computing chip front, AMD finds itself engaged in a fierce competition with Intel. Although it has managed to capture a portion of the market share, it still trails significantly behind its rival (sure it's taking some server share, but at what margins?). The prospect of AMD leveraging Microsoft's heavily marketed ""copilot computers"" seems to be the company's primary play, but this alone is unlikely to justify the lofty valuations it currently commands.

Given these considerations, it may be prudent for investors holding AMD stocks to use tomorrow's ""dead cat bounce (if it comes),"" and exit their positions. The risks associated with AMD's current trajectory appear to outweigh the potential rewards, at least in the near term.

Take your money and run.  AMD is not a great buy.

AMD - don't buy the dip,0,1bvz13j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvz13j/amd_dont_buy_the_dip/,64,1712265081.0,"Trigger alert: this post is about one of your favorite stocks.  So... here we go.

AMD's stock has experienced an 8% decline, fueled by speculation ""something"" happened in the middle-east (Iran saber rattling) or something else (interest rate cuts may not happen).  If you had shorted the stock, congratulations.  If you are long, read on.

Reality is these were excuses.  This is a risk off play, but also a move away from non-value that AMD represents at the current buy price.  AMD's been going higher surrounding its potential to produce groundbreaking AI chips. However, this optimism appears to be misplaced for a few reasons. Firstly, AMD's so-called AI chips have not been widely adopted by users, casting doubt on their significance. Secondly, even if AMD manages to make notable strides in AI, NVIDIA could simply respond by lowering prices, nullifying AMD's potential advantage.

On the computing chip front, AMD finds itself engaged in a fierce competition with Intel. Although it has managed to capture a portion of the market share, it still trails significantly behind its rival (sure it's taking some server share, but at what margins?). The prospect of AMD leveraging Microsoft's heavily marketed ""copilot computers"" seems to be the company's primary play, but this alone is unlikely to justify the lofty valuations it currently commands.

Given these considerations, it may be prudent for investors holding AMD stocks to use tomorrow's ""dead cat bounce (if it comes),"" and exit their positions. The risks associated with AMD's current trajectory appear to outweigh the potential rewards, at least in the near term.

Take your money and run.  AMD is not a great buy.

I happened to reply to someone's comment on a post that they could message me if they have questions about understanding options and got hit by almost 10 people in a matter of just a couple of hours (and this is with that offer being hidden deep into a post) so it seems like this may be a good thing to share.

Seize the Future: Why Investing in Reddit Stock is a Smart Move,0,1bw0eoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bw0eoi/seize_the_future_why_investing_in_reddit_stock_is/,14,1712268157.0,"I‚Äôm here to talk straight to the point about an opportunity that‚Äôs knocking on our doors ‚Äì investing in Reddit. Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúReddit isn‚Äôt profitable yet.‚Äù But let‚Äôs look beyond today and into the future.

Investing in Reddit is akin to planting an oak tree. It doesn‚Äôt provide immediate shade, but with time, it grows into something unshakeable. Reddit has been building its roots for over 20 years, creating a community that‚Äôs nothing short of a force of nature, with a market value that‚Äôs on the rise.

Reddit is a global brand, and it‚Äôs just warming up. The market swings like a pendulum between fear and greed. Currently, fear might be holding some back, but remember, greed in the right measure can be good. It drives us towards life, money, love, and knowledge, and it‚Äôs what will propel Reddit‚Äôs stock forward.

So, are you a wolf or a sheep? Wolves make decisions, hunt, and control their destiny. Sheep follow and hesitate. And we all know, hesitation leads to missed opportunities.

Investing in Reddit now means grabbing the future by the horns. It‚Äôs not just about the present numbers; it‚Äôs about the potential that‚Äôs yet to be reflected. It‚Äôs about being part of a larger narrative, a history in the making.

Let‚Äôs not just watch history unfold; let‚Äôs be the ones to write it. Are you ready to join me on this journey?

Looking forward to your thoughts and discussions below!",2024-04-04 22:02:37,2024-04-04 22:02:37+00:00

The Hershey Company

Exchange - Listed on both NYSE and NASDAQ

Ticker Symbol - HSY

The Hershey Company is known for their chocolate bars but they also sell many other snacks and candy using over 20 different brand names including Jolly Rancher, and Kit Kat. While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states ""our retail partners transition to a storytelling role"" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.

By transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.

Based on my research, Hershey's could be a good investment. Their stock price is down right now as a result of supply chain issues, however to to their ubiquitous name, I don't think they are going anywhere as a company and will probably return to normal levels of growth after adjusting their business practices. They have also been increasing dividend percentages rapidly, almost doubling in the last year to ease the pain of a falling stock price. While many investors may see red as a sign of a company doing bad, in this case, it is an opportunity to invest in a company that has proven to have room for growth.",2024-04-04 23:46:08,2024-04-04 23:46:08+00:00
