2024-03-31 00:17:13+00:00,1711844233.0,scarr34,"So let's look at one of the signature prices of Biden legislation,  which was the second COVID relief package. Or stimulus. Or whatever you like to call it. It had stimulus checks (the 1400 dollar ones) the increase in unemployment benefits. The increase in child tax credits. Money for small business like restaurants. Tons of money for COVID stuff like testing and tracing and the like. 

We can argue whether those things were good uses of our money.  There's real debates to be had. But the fact is because none of that package went to increasing production (building factories or roads or bridges etc) and because we don't have a savings account as a country (in fact we consistently spend more than we bring in) this package was paid with new money. Either fiscally or monetarily depending on the particular piece of the bill.  The net result is/was more dollars chasing fewer goods.  That creates inflation.

MMM (modern monetary theory) tells us that government spending doesn't matter. It also tells us that a government can inflate it's debt away. The idea being you pay ur debts with printed dollars. I honestly believe many in the Biden camp thought at first they could do this and it wouldn't have negative effects, and they were wrong.  Because the only way MMM works is if the dollars your printing increase production.  That's why they sold off half the spr. Lowering the cost of oil lowers the cost of almost everything.  

That said the economy has been very resilient. And it would be wrong to say everything they did or have done has been wrong.  They passed a giant infrastructure bill that hadn't really worked it's way into the economy. That may lower inflation in the long term.  Just as the chips act (which I'm against as it's a giant give away to some of the biggest most profitable companies in earth) may result in cheaper American made high tech chips which could be a net positive for the economy. But because all of this will be deficit spending, they will be short term inflationary, and that's by design.",,False,kxbvvj6,False,t3_1br64s9,t1_kxbpao9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br64s9/biden_using_strategic_petroleum_reserves_to_hide/kxbvvj6/,False,1.0,False,1br64s9,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

‚Ä¢ Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.

2024-03-31 00:59:37+00:00,1711846777.0,oxygenthievery,"I do see the amusement in using that word, I wish it was intentional! I'm not going to list out reems of information that surround advances in disease treatment, that wouldn't be a good use of anyone's time but the vast majority of illnesses one may encounter in their lifetime have some sort of medicinal treatment, who researches/makes those treatments? 

In fact, I'll bite and give one example that will hopefully show how complex things can be - Salbutamol. Salbutamol was effectively seen as a wonder drug when it came out as it meant that people suffering from asthma could get instantaneous relief from symptoms of an asthma attack, which is (often) a side effect of poor air quality in our industrial world. These are dry powder inhalers, in the little canister is a propellant and powdered salbutamol. It isn't enough to simply synthesise salbutamol - you have to get it into the right spaces in the lungs for it to be effective. A lot of R&D goes into pharmaceutical compounds, to the point where the crystalline form and the specific size profiles of your drug are registered with the FDA. Batches outside of these crystal forms do not conform to the restrictions of your drug registration so you cannot use them (really interesting case studies of problems with the crystal form can be found if you search for 'the disappearing polymorph', Wikipedia has a decent page on it). Some crystal forms of a drug are inactive (often due to solubility issues), meaning you could do all the initial R&D work, find a drug that works and then discover you can't make the right crystal form at scale (due to the energetics behind crystal formation, lab does not equal plant, some chemical reactions scale awfully). The production process had to be researched and designed so that it would reliably make salbutamol in the size specification every time, particles too big wouldn't get deep enough into the lungs, particles too small would but could be exhaled before they could land on surfaces to be absorbed into the lungs. When batches go out of spec, they can't simply dump the batch and move onto the next one - there are manufacturing timetables, they have to understand why it was out of spec so that it didn't happen again, people rely on medication (especially one like this) so problems have to be fixed fast so as not to disrupt supply... if a drug is out of spec, the problem can be 'some of the particles are slightly too large'; this is complex stuff that is heavily regulated so that people are getting the drug they need in the spec that it was proven to work in. Even things such as 'how do we make sure people are getting the right dose every single time' had to be checked and researched, instructions on how to properly use one of the inhalers researched and written etc. This drug did however, give many people (particularly children) a lifeline and allowed them to live normal, active lifestyles because it simply allowed them to breathe when they needed to. Ventolin (brand name for GSK salbutamol inhalers) still makes GSK over $1bn/year (from last I read) even though it is off patent and there are a tonne of generics because it's trusted and it works.

There are plenty of instances of pharmaceutical companies doing shady and odeous shit, you don't need to resort to hyperbolic statements to highlight that, nor should you forget the positive things many of these companies have done to improve peoples' livelihoods.",,False,kxc27yd,False,t3_1bro25i,t1_kxbx96i,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bro25i/ozempic_maker_novo_nordisk_facing_pressure_as/kxc27yd/,False,3.0,False,1bro25i,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

For whatever the reason, some people may have trouble starting this cycle of cutting calories. This medicine greatly aids people into starting the lifestyle change.

For weight loss it's not a cure all because you still have to learn to not eat whatever is in sight while the medicine acts as a helper.

The ""devouring mother"" is a psychological archetype that describes a mother who is overbearing, controlling, and manipulative towards her children. This type of mother seeks to keep her children dependent and infantilized, undermining their ability to become independent and self-sufficient.

Some key characteristics of the devouring mother include:

\- Overprotectiveness and an unwillingness to allow the child independence or autonomy

\- Emotional manipulation, using guilt or other tactics to maintain control

\- Sabotaging the child's attempts at separation or individuation

\- Prioritizing her own emotional needs over the child's development

The devouring mother archetype is often associated with personality disorders like narcissism or borderline personality disorder. It represents the ""shadow"" or negative aspect of the nurturing, protective mother archetype.

Overcoming the impact of a devouring mother can be challenging, but some strategies include:

\- Prioritizing your own self-care and emotional needs

\- Setting boundaries and asserting your independence 

\- Seeking therapy or counseling to address underlying attachment issues

\- Cultivating supportive relationships outside the family

The goal is to break free from the psychological and emotional control of the devouring mother, and develop a stronger, more autonomous sense of self. It's a difficult process, but an important one for personal growth and healing.

My guess is the algos jump it up after the ER followed by a short drop as it gets digested as the numbers won‚Äôt look that great on the guidance side.

If TSM doesn't make chips in Taiwan, Apple doesn't sell a product. No one else can make Apple's flagship chips. 

TSMs foreign plants would be in super high demand, commanding outrageous profits on every chip to meet world demand with such lower capacity. 

But All newest gen chips, everything Apple needs for a flagship product will not be produced by a different company for 5-8 years.

IT's not just Apple, MANY companies will have nothing to sell for YEARS. It's not like they can take these designs to anyone else. NO one has the capabilities. 

**What would happen:**  
China invades Taiwan, The US has declared that it will bomb TSM facilities rather then let China have them. Before the bombing, TSM knowledge and manpower would be airlifted out.  In a **MAXIMUM of 2.5 years** A new TSM facility would be rushed to completion in the US. ASML would divert its next shipment of tooling to the US. TSM would get Hundreds of Billions in development money to make chip facilities in the US, Europe, Japan. 

TSM knowledge and workforce has to stay together and be used in order to get these flagship chips made in 2-5 years. You need to have the teams in place that currently only exist in TSM. If other companies could do it with 10 - 50 Billion, they would. It's not a problem that money alone can fix. You need money and time with the right people. We would not have the 5-10 years to go from where the current capabilities of these other companies can do to getting to 3NM.

**TSM would DOMINATE, there stock would 8-16x in the next few years.** 

For 5 years the world would be producing half the chips it demands. $2 chips will be $20. $100 chips will be $1500. And $1000 chips will be nonexistent. TSM will still be creating a huge amount of the worlds chips, raking in record profits.  
NVIDEA, Apple, Tesla, would take a huge hit. There products would stack up, chipless and they would shutter plants. There losses / not selling anything would be considered a one time thing, their stock would crash for a month like the pandemic, and then slowly ramp back up as the uncertainty would clear up.",,False,kxcjsif,False,t3_1brv5tx,t1_kxc1gms,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brv5tx/tsm_earnings_play/kxcjsif/,False,0.0,False,1brv5tx,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-03-31 03:07:48+00:00,1711854468.0,InevitableBluejay435," Is AAPL getting sued an opportunity for wider growth?

(I'm leveraged in as an appl options holder)

The full potential of any organization is within a wider system of growth right? Facebook found that out the hard way when it reached near full penetration of the ""internet market"" and had to find ways to grow the wider net.

Apple as a closed system was in many ways started to corner huge parts of the hardware market at multiple layers of integration. This is by economics principles constrictive to wider market growth as defined by classical incentives challenges I.E. ""the agency issue"" meets capitalistic dictatorship. Apple doesn't want that either, if its goal is unlimited growth.

The US capitalistic system is in many ways founded in utilitarianism principles too, which means by that definition that the US has a vested interest in maintaining balance within it's ecosystem. Monopoles aren't good for growth, and by utilitarian standards, an organization should only net profit over term when it net profits society too. Dollars can sometimes be excused as a proxy for value creation, but that again breaks in a monopoly scenario.

Ok so, both parties win how? How can the pie grow for the wider system while growing for AAPL too? What's your take?",,False,kxck504,False,t3_1bqy544,t3_1bqy544,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqy544/weekend_discussion_thread_for_march_29_2024/kxck504/,False,3.0,False,1bqy544,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

HBM is really just a packaging method, where the DRAM is 3D stacked and/or placed closer to the cpu/gpu, leading to the name- high bandwidth memory. HBM techniques lead to faster read/writes to DRAM. 

I've been either making chips in the fab or directly related efforts for 25 years now, including cpu, nand, and dram. It's kinda my thing. 

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying. But it sounds like you are a product user. Just Google it. Google HBM and whether it's SRAM or DRAM. HINT: It's DRAM. SK Hynix holds the largest share of it currently, > 50% of the market: and Hynix doesn't build compute, at least in any major leading edge quantities. (They actually do build a small amount of niche stuff at older nodes in a couple fabs they acquired, but that's beside the point.)

As another side note, several players have tried (unsuccessfully to any great level) to build DRAM monolithically on logic. Intel has a process, the caps are put between M4 and M5. But achieving the density of modern DRAM is literally impossible, as is getting anywhere near DRAM densities in SRAM. Cache size is normally measured in MB- DRAM in GB.",,False,kxckunz,False,t3_1bqwb6e,t1_kx96ayk,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqwb6e/msft_and_openai_plan_100_billion_supercomputer/kxckunz/,False,1.0,False,1bqwb6e,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

‚Ä¢ Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

‚Ä¢ Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

‚Ä¢ Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else.

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

You need electricity to make ""green hydrogen"" and it takes 4X as much electricity to make the hydrogen to power a FCEV for the same mileage as just charging a BEV. Whats even funnier is that to build a Nikola semi you also have to include a sizeable 250kwh lithium buffer battery. Also, currently most stations will take 40+ minutes to refuel a Nikola semi.

Think about it, people buy phones at a third of the rate they used to, apple watch isn't a thing anymore, everyone already has ear pods and the new ones aren't enough of an upgrade to warrant the spend. So what do they do? They come out with a VR headset that basically does nothing, and they charge a shit tone for it so only the rich boys can afford to play with it for a week before it collects dust.

2024-03-31 04:59:57+00:00,1711861197.0,Any_Yogurtcloset362,"I think the selloff was warranted. As much as Slootman isn‚Äôt a tech person, he was highly trusted by both analysts and investors so his announcement to step down was a bit jarring. I‚Äôm finding it pretty amusing how bad succession planning in general has been the last few years.  Disney botching Chapek now seems more like the norm than an outlier.  An ex-Googler - Google being the company who seems a step behind and playing catch up on AI (not necessarily my belief but that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs being portrayed in market) - is now having to play catch up on Snowflake, makes for a really BAD PR story (warranted or not, it‚Äôs still bad that it exists).  I think Snowflake did it all in one shot with the announcement though given they knew the stock was going to get punished one way or the other on the ER.

Now your technical arguments make sense BUT in large scale organizations you‚Äôre not accounting for how Snowflake is procured.  Redshift and Databricks have lower barriers to entry given their native access through AWS and Azure respectively.  Better technology be damned if you need to involve procurement and finance to get involved with getting a new product.  For both Redshift and Databricks, I can just spin up resources on my pre-existing agreements that have been blessed and go to town.  When you get Snowflake, you‚Äôre having to get your procurement and CFO to understand their credit system, look at an agreement with legal, get paperwork signed, allocate funding and budget, and then hopefully if everyone is in a good mood, get things signed in a reasonable amount of time.

The real issue for them is going to be the barrier to entry given the extra work to even get into a company. It‚Äôs not just readily available. I‚Äôve worked on multiple Snowflake deals and while the technical people want the product, it‚Äôs back and forth with Finance to make sure everything is right that causes all the frustration and the technical people just giving up to using something with less onboarding friction.

Snowflake‚Äôs push into the data market business is probably the biggest growth potential for them.  Their ability to be an agnostic data mart would streamline a lot of work and help smaller businesses from having to deploy expensive multicloud landing zones just for data connectivity. Given how much orgs can spend on data, if they can figure out how to reasonably monetize this and streamline it for technical use, they could create a very wide moat.",,False,kxcxgm4,False,t3_1brznws,t3_1brznws,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brznws/snowflake_selloff_seems_like_a_temporary_accident/kxcxgm4/,False,12.0,False,1brznws,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-03-31 05:26:26+00:00,1711862786.0,unclesadoofus,"We live in a ""special"" time economically. The world is super crappy right now. It is alienating a ton of nice people who are intrinsically cooperative and affectionate, and making them feel used, hopeless, expendable, and frustrated.

There are a LOT of people around who are not nice. They are firmly not in cooperative, sharing, or transparent mode. They are all about competing, about defending their right to be secretly or openly jerkish, about insisting other people prove their worth to justify existing. 

You don't need to buy that. You don't need to prove your worth. You have default worth.

I have this personal rule. Packs are important. A pack means the people we're fond of and who are fond of us. But my rule is this: you can't prop up somebody who is determined to fall down, even if they are in your pack. That is beyond your territory. 

Why? Because it doesn't work. You can see it not working all around you, such as when an elderly parent keeps making a bad decision over and over again, or when somebody keeps rock climbing despite getting injured repeatedly. 

If you try to prop somebody up who is determined to fall down, then it has a specific consequence. It breaks not just you but your whole pack. 

I'm not talking about propping up somebody weak or helpless. You can often help the weak or helpless. Instead I'm talking about somebody who is determined to make decisions that sabotage efforts to help them.

So if somebody isn't helping me support them, but is making it actively harder, yet still demanding I help them, and making me feel guilty about it...then it's a sign I have reached my territorial limit. In other words, that is the point at which I can no longer save my pack, as my pack is determined to crumble - and willing to sacrifice me in the process. So I must save myself.

There are actually wonderful, nice, decent, thoughtful, sane, supportive people out there who feel just as you do. People who don't want to be jerks. You can find them.

If any of this is relevant. It's probably not. But just in case.

Just get the maximum allowed size for your personal carry on bag and stop packing a billion things on every trip. If you‚Äôre flying with multiple people you can share larger carry-ons too. They don‚Äôt even charge more for drinks than the airport vendors and if you have airport lounge access just bring a few cans of soda with you.

I can book a spirit flight, upgrade to the bigger seat, buy the WiFi pass, and buy myself a snack and still come in cheaper than a regular airline‚Äôs economy seat. Spirit mostly sucks if you‚Äôre a complete cheapskate who refuses to buy any extras at all for it to be less miserable. Bring an inflatable seat pad for their shitty hard plastic economy seats if you aren‚Äôt upgrading to the big ones, it‚Äôs like $10 for a nice one people take camping and takes up almost no space.

1) There‚Äôs an agreement that the impact of the first cut will be more symbolic than technically meaningful as it signals the beginning of the loosening cycle. But that signal is an extremely powerful one to the market.

2) Bostic and the other more hawkish members are concerned starting cuts will just reintroduce a new inflationary cycle destroying all the work the tightening did.  I think he‚Äôs trying to at least show he ‚Äúcares‚Äù about that but in the end, I think it‚Äôs mostly to keep the hawks engaged at the table.

3) Williams is hawkish BUT has started to make more comments related to labor market health.  This is probably going to become the more major focus - while the economy is still strong, it won‚Äôt mean nothing if unemployment spikes.  I think this is where the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate gets interesting.  If unemployment spikes they‚Äôll need to eat the inflationary risks to prevent further labor market damage. The last thing Powell wants to do is get grilled at his next hearing on how they were late to the party and how everyone is out of a job.  This is not the hill he wants to die on.  So he can now at least say ‚Äúhey we made it known about the inflationary risks BUT we also can‚Äôt have 5% of the labor force working behind the Wendys‚Äù

4) While Trump has his own campaign fund in DJT, the Fed will want to stay apolitical as much as possible. If they don‚Äôt cut in June, it‚Äôs going to put them in an awkward position to do a rate cut in Sept or Nov.  If June goes out, there‚Äôs a chance of no rate cuts - which is what Morgan Stanley just came out with the other day.  Powell won‚Äôt want to have to explain that at the next hearing either.  Blackrock described it best which is ‚Äúmaintenance cuts‚Äù. If they keep them to 25bp it gives them the ability to make minor but symbolic impact and still reserve the right to increase them if needed.

5) Rents are trending in the right direction. Out of all the components that provide the Fed the most hesitation - it‚Äôs finally making progress. He says they aren‚Äôt targeting it specifically but it‚Äôs one of the most sticky points and lower rates can help that further once they are comfortable with everything else.

The consolidated dot plot at least shows overall consensus forming which is great. I think he just needs to do a little more pleading with the hawks so he won‚Äôt get raw dogged without lube by Warren at the next hearing over shit she knows nothing about.

What's more likely is that you don't see another path right now - as many others don't see one when they are left in a trapped situation.

You are not actually trapped. There are other paths. They involve taking over the territory someone else has made you feel isn't yours, but that is yours. For example, you can draw boundaries about what you will do and what you won't, instead of letting yourself give more and more until you have nothing left. 

You can identify where those boundaries are by sensing what starts to make you break. As soon as the solution to a problem seems to be one of destruction, then this is an indication that you've reached your limit. Figure out for next time where the boundary is so you don't get there. I can totally do examples if you need them.

Anyway I'm wording this as advice, but it's more the way I work, not the way you should work. You know your situation best. You know what you can take and what you can't, what makes sense and what doesn't.

But as a stranger over here, reading what you wrote, I really feel like you are not trapped. Some people will just push us until we break. They kinda have no right to do that.

Wait - unless they're our kids - I mean kids don't choose to be born - we do that to them - so I think we should be ready to sacrifice for them. 

But parents putting that on kids? No, offspring get to have their own territory. Nobody should be pushed out of what is truly their own territory. Everyone has a right to manage their territory - to a reasonable limit. 

Like, some of our territory is shared, not personal. Like public spaces. 

Try to figure out which territory is yours, and yours alone, and which is shared. Then defend your territory. You don't have to be a jerk to defend your territory. You only have to assume you're worthy.

But yeah at this point pretty much every single American's name, DOB, SSN, employment history, credit scores, email, phones, addresses are all fully available en bulk for like free or a few bucks on the dark web.

Remember when Equifax+TransUnion leaked everyone's information and everyone just collectively shrugged?? good times.

I'll repeat some steps that everyone here should do (but some won't because they're regarded but I'll keep repeating this incase it helps even just *1* person avoid getting scammed and dealing with hours of fighting fraud):

1. Toggle 100% credit freeze on TU/TP/Equifax (sign up on their sites with your info before someone else uses your info to sign up for you). Do this now if you haven't. It's just too important.  Yeah its annoying if you need to open a new line of credit but at least you can just go in and toggle it off for a 72-hour period . It's better to be in control of this yourself than having someone just buy your dopey DOB and SSN for $1 and open $50,000 in credit lines in your name without you even knowing it.
2. Sign up for [SSA.gov](https://SSA.gov) with your SSN before someone else does. This at least locks it in place and you have full control over your Social Security account in perpertuit. Otherwise if you haven't signed up, someone else will.
3. Make sure you got solid Authenticator 2FA on everything important from Robinhood, Vanguard, Banks, whatever. Don't use email 2FA if you can avoid it. This one is stupidly obvious I feel stupid even putting it out there... and yet there are still people not using it.
4. If your cell service has it, use EID/eSIM registration instead of SIM card. Getting SIM-jacked is only marginally worse than getting cum-jacked
5. If your bank offers free credit monitoring (most good ones should), set it up to send you an monthly report so you can at least review and make sure no one is opening cell phones or credit lines or taking out car loans in your name or whatever. CreditKarma fucking sucks ass, don't use them.
6. I put a monthly calendar reminder on my phone to force myself to go through all of my debit/credit statements at the end of the month just to scan for fraudulent shit. I absolutely hate doing this, I'd rather eat a fucking light bulb, but I really have to do it -- and everyone else should too. It's so easy for credit card numbers to get scammed out the wazoo these days. Think about how many apps you probably entered payment information and then think about how many are setup by incompetent Bob The Pervert and barely functioning VC garbage.  If you catch fraud charges quick enough, disputing and getting money back isn't that hard but it gets more annoying the longer they're there. Just do it as a habit.

We're in the scam economy folks.  It's just scams from here on out. The amount of scam texts I've been getting the past 12 months is up like 500%, it's just non-stop.

I really feel like a gay ass 90-year-old boomer having to type that shit up, but it can be no joke. You might be poor nobody working at Wendys with -$1000 on margin calls, but someone can turn that into -$100,000 in your name popping open a bunch of credit lines, buying a new car, and then flying to the Bahamas on your information. Nobodies are the perfect targets because they also don't check or think about any of this shit.

Why ?¬†

Keep strongly in mind that Nvidia Corp dropped over 5% (a very big deal)or 5.07% over 2 days or from March 26 and 27,2024.¬†

So what.¬†

Every single time Nvidia has dropped 4% to 7% over the last month, it has completely recovered that loss soon after or within 1 to 5 days.¬†

Prove it.¬†

By the way,I dislike shakeouts as much as most retail investors. Not pleasant at all. Deeply awful experience.¬†

Tidal wave one.¬†

It happened March 8 to 11,2024 with a loss of 7.55% over 2 days.¬†

Brutal. ‚ÄúBlood in the streets‚Äù kind of days. Stomach-turning. ¬†¬†

But like Baron Rothschild¬† said. ‚ÄúBuy when there's blood in the streets, EVEN if the blood is your OWN‚Äù¬†

https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/05/25/buy-when-theres-blood-in-the-streets-how-contrarians-get-it-right/

Subsequently Nvidia went up 7.16% to $919.13 per share.¬†

Hurricane two.¬†

It happened March 13 to 15,2024 with a loss of 4.54% over 3 days.¬†

Rough to endure. Blood,sweat and tears.¬†

Subsequently went up 7.90% to¬† $950.02 per share.¬†

Earthquake three.¬†

It happened¬† March 26 to 27,2024 with a loss of 5.04%¬† over 2 days.¬†

Awful days. I can barely stomach the drops kind of days.¬†

Subsequently, March 28,2024 was a minor recovery.So far. Now at $903.56 per share. Much more coming.¬†

Held support at $891 per share. Over two days.¬†

So,what‚Äôs next.¬†

April 1 to 5,2024 it will recover at least 5% or more. ¬†

I expect a SURPRISE breakout above the $974.00 high set on March 8,2024.¬†

If you got stock or call options,you will be a very happy investor this upcoming week.Positive.¬†

We could possibly break the magic $1,000 per share. We shall see.

Zero worries and stress.¬†

Nvidia stock will deliver¬† life-changing gains.¬†

Live long and prosper.¬† Hope that helps.¬† March 30,2024¬† Lovely Saturday.¬†

One quote from unknown within one of the comment threads that's stuck w/ me for long said something in lines of: ""Investors don't trade on 'Good News'; they trade on the 'Expectation' of 'Good News'."" I thought $CCL was another case of that Message being realized, until I kinda took a deeper look into their earnings to verify if the Market was simply on its period for a valuable Company.

Nope. The Market be smart.

$CCL's Growth Potential is quite done. It's really deceptive if you look at the $$ Value Amount growing in terms of YoY Revenue changes, but in %% terms, it goes like this for its last 7 Fiscal Quarters (Q3,FY22\~Q1,FY24):

688% ‚Üí 198% ‚Üí 173% ‚Üí 105% ‚Üí 59% ‚Üí 41% ‚Üí 22%

Its 6/7 past Fiscal Quarters had negative Net Income. Instead of enjoying its ""Take-Home Pay,"" it's been counting up its ""Take-Away-from-Home Pay"" lollll

(-$770M) ‚Üí (-$1,600M) ‚Üí (-$693M) ‚Üí (-$407M) ‚Üí $1070M ‚Üí (-$48M) ‚Üí (-$214M)

Its D/E Ratio (Debt-to-Equity Ratio) is quite high. Like, its' borrowed about 5.04 times more than it has gotten from selling its Stock Shares, on average for the last 7 FQs. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I'm not sure if holding onto that type of Capital Structure is helpful @ times when FED-sama is keeping that yung rate damn near exalted perpetually, every now & then going: ""Say you want Daddy's rates cut‚Äï3 times"" w/ soft voices w/o actually doing anything for a Fiscal Decade. It's too reasonable for me to assume $CCL has been getting their cheeks clapped by the stacks of Interest Charge Invoices.  

I honestly don't even know how its had a run up for as long as it had lol, but I'm too tired to dig any deeper. Puts brah ain't nobody want this as an investment.

2024-03-31 07:18:42+00:00,1711869522.0,MaryAnnGrysbeck,"Definitely still very bullish on Nvidia Corp. as of March 30,2024.¬†

Why ?¬†

Keep strongly in mind that Nvidia Corp dropped over 5% (a very big deal)or 5.07% over 2 days or from March 26 and 27,2024.¬†

So what.¬†

Every single time Nvidia has dropped 4% to 7% over the last month, it has completely recovered that loss soon after or within 1 to 5 days.¬†

Prove it.¬†

By the way,I dislike shakeouts as much as most retail investors. Not pleasant at all. Deeply awful experience.¬†

Tidal wave one.¬†

It happened March 8 to 11,2024 with a loss of 7.55% over 2 days.¬†

Brutal. ‚ÄúBlood in the streets‚Äù kind of days. Stomach-turning. ¬†¬†

But like Baron Rothschild¬† said. ‚ÄúBuy when there's blood in the streets, EVEN if the blood is your OWN‚Äù¬†

May 25,2012. 'Buy When There's Blood In The Streets': How Contrarians Get It Right

https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/05/25/buy-when-theres-blood-in-the-streets-how-contrarians-get-it-right/

Subsequently Nvidia went up 7.16% to $919.13 per share.¬†

Hurricane two.¬†

It happened March 13 to 15,2024 with a loss of 4.54% over 3 days.¬†

Rough to endure. Blood,sweat and tears.¬†

Subsequently went up 7.90% to¬† $950.02 per share.¬†

Earthquake three.¬†

It happened¬† March 26 to 27,2024 with a loss of 5.04%¬† over 2 days.¬†

Awful days. I can barely stomach the drops kind of days.¬†

Subsequently, March 28,2024 was a minor recovery.So far. Now at $903.56 per share. Much more coming.¬†

Held support at $891 per share. Over two days.¬†

So,what‚Äôs next.¬†

April 1 to 5,2024 it will recover at least 5% or more. ¬†

I expect a SURPRISE breakout above the $974.00 high set on March 8,2024.¬†

If you got stock or call options,you will be a very happy investor this upcoming week.Positive.¬†

We could possibly break the magic $1,000 per share. We shall see.

Zero worries and stress.¬†

Nvidia stock will deliver¬† life-changing gains.¬†

Live long and prosper.¬† Hope that helps.¬† March 30,2024¬† Lovely Saturday.¬†

System in China with battery swapping aint that great compared to european version I am not gonna lie on that.

2024-03-31 11:58:19+00:00,1711886299.0,EntrepreneurNo4587,"Bullish as never - The S&P 500 is up 10.2% for the first three months of 2024. That‚Äôs only the fourth time since the start of the millennium it has gained 8% or more in the first three months of the year, joining 2012, 2013, and 2019, when it rose 12%, 10%, and 13.1%, respectively. 

Previously, it hadn‚Äôt done so since before the dot-com bubble burst in 1998, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Overall, the index has managed to gain 8% or more during the first quarter only 17 times since 1950.

There‚Äôs more to cheer the bulls up. Of the 16 times the S&P 500 has man-aged to rise 8% or more in the first quarter from 1950 through 2023, only once‚Äîin 1987, the year of the Black Monday crash‚Äîdid the index lose ground in the rest of the year. In the other 15 years, the index gained an average of 9.7% during the subsequent three quarters. In other words, going back roughly three-quarters of a century, if the S&P 500 climbs 8% or more in the first quarter, there‚Äôs a nearly 94% chance of more gains.

Overall, that bodes well for 2024‚Äôs ongoing momentum. However, there is a decent chance that the gains during the rest of the year won‚Äôt match the first quarter‚Äôs.

In 10 of the 15 years noted above (excluding 1987), the first quarter‚Äôs gains were higher than those seen in the second through fourth quarters, including in 2012, when the first quarter‚Äôs 12% pop outshone the 1.3% rise seen for the rest of the year.

Nonetheless, in 2013 and 2019, the S&P 500 did rally stronger in the last three quarters of the year than the first.

More to the point, a year that begins as strong as 2024 has rarely let investors down, outside of a black swan event.",,False,kxdwjya,False,t3_1brl1oj,t3_1brl1oj,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brl1oj/bullish_or_bearish_powell_interview/kxdwjya/,False,1.0,False,1brl1oj,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

So of course there was no demand for swapping if the only swapping station was at some resort outside of highways etc. I think back then swapping cost way more and Tesla did not have the money for it. Thats why they lost intrest in it. 

By bad with the bad battery health, but you can‚Äôt deny that when its time to change the battery, it wont be cheap. BaaS would be really handy in that situation. Its easier to pay monthly fee about 70 bucks than replace the battery after 10-12 years. And pay 10k for new battery to already old car. 

With standard range Tesla, 10 % decrease in range starts to feel in everyday use especially if you drive even bit longer to work or in use it in colder environments. 

Nio has completed 40+million swaps already with only about 450 k cars on road. That sounds like it is working. Also, if you want make a Nio long range for a week, you can rent a 100kw or 150 kw battery. Sounds pretty nice to me. No need to spend money on long range car, if you dont need it everyday.

Nio has 8 billion dollars in cash, so Id say the changes with bankrupty are same as with Tesla in 2015. But they are still making money after they sell the car. With BaaS and their charging network. In fact, they make money even they dont sell a car. Around 80 % of Nio charger users are not Nio owners.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

2024-03-31 15:10:28+00:00,1711897828.0,OTForlyfe,"So I opened a premium card a few years ago and was looking through all of them to see which is best for me. I was between amex platinum, chase reserve and capital one venture X. I ended up going with Venture X because in the long run the yearly cost of keeping it is free and you eat 5$ a year. 

First year- you get 300$ travel credit to use on capital one travel. You can get up to 750$ in the first few months by reaching a certain amount I think it‚Äôs 3,000$ but don‚Äôt quote me. And global entry is reimbursed about 100$. That‚Äôs that‚Äôs 1150$ in rewards the first year. 

I opened this card because I was going to Italy later that year so the bonuses paid for my flight entirely and a hotel stay for 4 of the nights I was there. There was an issue with my flight when I got to the airport, the airline didn‚Äôt see my second flight (the international one) and when I called the capital one travel line they got me onto the next flight with no additional charge with little to no stress. Come to find out it was actually the airline that had messed up the reservation but didn‚Äôt want to take accountability for it, so I‚Äôm glad capital one was able to take care of me in a very stressful moment. 

2nd year- the 300$ travel credit plus a anniversary 10,000 points to use which comes out to 100$. That‚Äôs 400$ in rewards and the cost of keeping the car is 395$. 

In addition hotel stays are 10x, flights are 5x and everything else is 2x. 

A hack I learned is that if you pay for the hotel/ flight with the card you get the 10x or 5x points and then you can use your points to scrub your purchase and still keep the points earned. 

I also need to get all new tires for my car, and the discount program they have through the app is amazing. I saved 17% on my tires which were expense and they shipped them straight to my door for free. I went through tire agent through the capital one portal and saved over 200$ for replacing my tires which I found was also a win. 

I end up not paying for flights year round with the amount of rewards that get built in the past 3 years of having the card. 

You also get capital one lounge access. There‚Äôs only 3 right now but said they are expanding to more airports the Dulles one is SO nice. You also get access to some other lounges with the priority pass. 

There‚Äôs so many more benefits, these are the ones that I found the most useful. 

Use this link for more rewards if you feel like this card is for you

https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1YZ0GO/

https://amp.dw.com/en/china-investigates-sars-like-virus-as-dozens-struck-by-pneumonia/a-51843861

Part of why you‚Äôre not finding it is back then they called it an infectious pneumonia.

‚ÄúOn 8 December 2019, the Chinese government identified the death of 1 patient and 41 others hospitalized with unknown etiology in Wuhan, a city in central China‚Äù

That‚Äôs when China first reported it to WHO. So I stand by my assertion that about mid December I was hearing news reports on TV about a potential outbreak in China.

What is clear is that the platform was dying when he bought it. And I don't think that was mostly because of the censorship and ""useless job positions"" as he put it.

I'm pretty sure it's just because Twitter fundamentally kind of sucks. The conversational format is one of the worst I've seen, a small step above OG forums. And the only niche it adds to the social media scene is a place for celebrities to speak directly to the public and for people to increase the fame to their name.

That's it, that's the only thing it's got going for it. It's like Facebook, but it's looser in terms of exposure to people you're not close to. The only purpose that serves is for what I said.

It could serve more purpose, but other social media platforms already serve those purposes, and do it very well. Like reddit, Instagram and Facebook. There's just not room for it to become a big player.

And the only reason it got as big as it did is because we've never had access to celebrities lives and thoughts like this before, but as a lot of people could have expected, it's not that interesting lol.

Getting that tied up in the drama of people's lives you don't even know is a very degenerate type of drama entertainment.

But you said it. They want a new car. But they sell the old one to someone, right? Who wants to buy 10 years old Tesla with pretty old battery? Not me. In ten years the battery cant be that good anymore.

But as you are an american, you live most likely single family home, or place where there is parking lot where you can charge. Because US is very autocentric and is it build that way. However, if you live in a bigger city, like LA, NYC, Seattle or some city like that It is way harder to charge your car at home. You may have not a solid place for your car. It is just randomly parked on diffrent parking lot or on a street. Then you need to charge it somewhere else, dont you think? Also, even though you are american, you cant say all 330 million americans think like you. Someone probably would love to have 10-15 k discont from the battery pack and rent it. And if they dont, they can also buy it. 

You probably do not want to see Teslas losses from 2011 to 2019. It did not look good. Nios -5.59 billion net income is in RMB not in dollars. Comparing for example Teslas 2017 losses, 2.2 billion dollars or 15 billion RMB. 2018 about 7.5 billion RMB. You can easily check that on google. 

Tesla has about 3.176 billion shares outstanding. Nio has 1.735 billion. Back in 2016 when Tesla sold about the same amount of cars as nio last year, were the sp about 14-16 dollars. So if adjusting to shares outstanding, there was not that big difference is sp price..? Taking in note we are comparing US stock and chinese, where chinese always is discounted comparing to direct rivals in US.

Also, I dont know where did you find that Nio has 6 billion dollars in cash as March 24‚Äô, I would like to see it also. However, it did have 8 billion dollars in last day of December 23‚Äô. 8000 million dollars. That is pretty much.

2024-03-31 16:21:48+00:00,1711902108.0,tkapn,"When you trade in the market, you are trading synthetic shares (beneficially owned shares). All shares are technically owned by Cede & Co, as nominated by the DTCC. You simply buy markers that gives you the right to recall one of these shares. And technically you only have beneficial ownership through your broker, they own it on your behalf (this is called having your shares in Street name).

The only way to recall or truly own your shares is to direct register them via your company's transfer agent. This pulls that real share out of the market (DTCC) and puts the share into your own name.

The problem is, there are likely (in several companies' cases) more shares circulating than exist at any one time. This is not limited to borrowed shares or shares that are obligated to be delivered but have not yet been. This can lead to all sorts of problems affecting true supply/demand.

Direct registering shares prevents your shares from being loaned out against your consent behind the scenes, and grants you true ownership.

The guy who bought all his shares on the market, likely did this through a broker and didn't truly own his shares.

Snowflake for ML has some good stuff in private/public preview but I wouldn't use it for ML in production yet (except for very specific instances).

Airflow is a great addition if you need to orchestrate things along with dbt.  There's also cosmos which is an Airflow operator for dbt that takes your dbt DAG and integrates it into your Airflow DAG.  You can also just trigger your dbt cloud job/runner from Airflow via API as well.

However, if all you care about is orchestrating your transformations (separate of ingestion) then dbt is a great solution.

I would argue in your situation Snowflake would be better for your use case as you could just provide the data to them via a share instead of having to do write back.  Less compute, networking, and faster data availability for your consumers.  That being said, then you need an ingestion mechanism into Snowflake.

2024-03-31 17:48:14+00:00,1711907294.0,nickerzb,"Effectively Snowflake and Databricks take the same approach.  You pay for usage at the warehouse level.  Databricks Serverless is essentially exactly what Snowflake is where you're paying for a compute ""size"" and for how long it's on.  This is why resource monitors (ensuring cost is within spec) and auto scaling policies (shut off when not in use for X duration) are critical as you're paying when the warehouse is on.

So it's really not about how much data you're processing... But rather a mix of how much compute you request and how long you use it for.  Generally speaking that's driven by the amount of data you need to process and the types of manipulation you're doing.

As an example, if I was processing 10 records and chose the biggest warehouse possible, I would pay a ton of money (even though it wouldn't take too long but you have cluster spin-up and cooloff time).  Alternatively if I chose the smallest warehouse possible, I would pay significantly less and my workload may even finish in the same amount of time.  This doesn't scale linearly generally though so basic recommendation is always to pick the smallest warehouse and see what your run times look like against your desired SLA... And scale the warehouse accordingly.",,False,kxfcxvv,False,t3_1brznws,t1_kxd7gke,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brznws/snowflake_selloff_seems_like_a_temporary_accident/kxfcxvv/,False,1.0,False,1brznws,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

I was freaking out because I didn‚Äôt have access to my phone and they were actively opening new accounts in my name.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

Notice what you don‚Äôt agree with, you label as ‚Äúswallowing the pill‚Äù, or attach the word ‚Äúprobably‚Äù before it, without any basis whatsoever for claiming so.

What are facts are:
- job numbers are up, trump actually left with negative job creation numbers
- GDP numbers are all up
- net deficits accrued within the same comparable time periods are down, by CBO numbers during both terms (those facts on trump profligate spending that Nicky Haley and Chris Christie shared with you guys btw)

Notice what you don‚Äôt agree with, you label as ‚Äúswallowing the pill‚Äù, or attach the word ‚Äúprobably‚Äù before it, without any reasoned basis whatsoever for claiming so.

What are facts are:
- job numbers are up, trump actually left with negative job creation numbers
- GDP numbers are all up, with and without the normal expected minor revisions
- net deficits accrued within the same comparable time periods are down, by CBO numbers during both terms (those facts on trump profligate spending that Nicky Haley and Chris Christie shared with you guys btw)
- our oil production is up compared to the trump years
- 401ks are mostly up. Many were net down when trump left
- stock markets are ALL up, all the indices

Other differences include the higher cost of education and childcare that make it harder to either buy a home OR have children, let alone do both.

Easy summaries of Teams meetings or threads will not strengthen decision making.

I also think that Machine Learning is a relevant tool that is NOT made accessible by Copilot.  

That said: 

1. I maintain that Copilot integration into teams will be a big selling feature and will boost MSFT's bottom line.

2. I maintain that Copilot actually does markedly improve search results.  It mostly weeds out a lot of the blatant selling generated by google's algorithm.  I still find it takes 3 or more attempts at refining the query to start to get the results I want, but it's still preferable to scrolling through pages of irrelevant ads.

>Epstein was rumoured to be associated with intelligence.[283] The US journalists Dylan Howard, Melissa Cronin and James Robertson linked Epstein to the Israeli Mossad in their book Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales. They relied for the most part on the former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe.[284] According to him, Epstein's activities as a spy served to gather compromising material on powerful people in order to blackmail them.[285] There is also a possible connection to the Mossad via Ghislaine Maxwell, whose father Robert Maxwell is said to have had contacts with the Mossad.[286] Epstein's victim Virginia Giuffre also alleged Epstein to be an intelligence asset, linking on Twitter to a Reddit page, that alleged Epstein being a spy, running a blackmail operation.[287]
As US Attorney in Florida, the later US Secretary of Labour Alexander Acosta reached a settlement with Epstein's lawyers (including Alan M. Dershowitz) in 2008, which allowed him to receive a very light prison sentence. Acosta later reportedly stated that he was told that Epstein ""belonged to intelligence"" and that the issue was above his ""pay grade."" According to Acosta, he was pushed to give him a good deal.[288]
Former diplomat and current CIA director William J. Burns met with Epstein three times. According to a CIA spokesperson, Burns hoped that Epstein would help him ""transition to the private sector.""[289]",,False,kxgj9sk,False,t3_1bsl47d,t1_kxgi7yz,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bsl47d/white_house_authorizes_weapons_transfers_to_israel/kxgj9sk/,False,55.0,False,1bsl47d,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

The American auto industry did the same thing to BMW and Mercedes, Honda and Toyota, Kia and Hyundai, etc. Every time someone beats them fair and square, they get super racist and start branding the cars as ‚ÄúNazi wagons,‚Äù ‚ÄúJap crap,‚Äù etc. Now they‚Äôre doing the exact same thing to Chinese cars. My made in China iPhone is pretty good. Why wouldn‚Äôt a BYD EV be good too? Warren Buffett is their biggest shareholder and Charlie Munger said it was the best investment he ever made. 

At the end of the day, you‚Äôre supposed to compete by making yourself better, not by bribing politicians to put tariffs on your competition and rolling back green energy policies. Michigan is the most important swing state so Biden, Trump, Sanders, etc. keep kissing their butt at the expense of far more people in California, Texas, New York, and Florida. And they just put that money in their pockets instead of doing anything to fix their hellhole cities/states.

Both articles are from December 31st 2019 though, not nearly as far out as you‚Äôd said originally. China keeps things fairly quiet when the news is negative so I‚Äôm not surprised that we didn‚Äôt hear much until then.

Judging by what you sent, it looks like December 8th is when China reported it to WHO, and that didn‚Äôt hit the news until the end of the month, the 31st. So I‚Äôm gonna stand by what I said: yes, the market knew before COVID before March, but the news really only got started in the beginning of January. Also, at that time it looked like standard news that pops up dozens of times per year. It‚Äôs pretty common to see news of pneumonia or flus in localized areas. We‚Äôve even gotten used to scary things like Ebola or Zika hitting some places but never really making the rounds in the western world.

I‚Äôd say though it‚Äôs technically true that COVID was known by markets before March, the fear really didn‚Äôt start ramping up until mid February, and didn‚Äôt truly scare most people until a few weeks after that.",,False,kxgl0cx,False,t3_1bqvqv9,t1_kxerbgf,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqvqv9/the_reason_why_jp_morgan_is_bearish/kxgl0cx/,False,1.0,False,1bqvqv9,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

BYD is outselling Tesla. Sales in China are down. Sales numbers as a whole are likely down. Elon's lost his court case over his bonus amount, and in turn made statements about withholding from Tesla if he doesn't obtain a set percentage of the company, the company's share price is at a steep decline that began early in the quarter and still is at a low state overall, currently the economy is still at a high federal interest rate (which affects Tesla sales) with no true determination when cuts will come (odds are they may not happen until 3rd quarter, if they happen this year); although a new and improved FSD was released, we still have no clear picture how much longer before full FSD will be available. The EV market in the US as a whole had a recent reality check. Polls still don't favor EV vehicles, and many consumers are even pushing back. Most of the major manufacturers have stepped back on EV production and development (on the basis that they don't believe in the current market of EV vehicles), and while this seems like an opportunity for Tesla to increase it's EV dominance in a market they already control, the major manufacturers have done what they can to convince the public that EV just isn't the right choice right now.

We can talk about a future of robots and taxis, but none of that will even begin to price in until it is upon us. Until then Tesla is a car company, and currently the car market is down.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. 

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",moderator,False,kxgpcl0,False,t3_1bsnav4,t3_1bsnav4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bsnav4/worst_performing_stock_in_sp_500_in_q/kxgpcl0/,False,1.0,True,1bsnav4,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

$JBLU was willing to pay $35/share. I can't imagine $LUV offering less than $25/share.

With the number of shares short being more than 28% of the float and considering the millions of shares that have been bought under $5 $SAVE is setup for a massive short squeeze. 

The funds were selling at the end of March as ""window dressing"". On Monday they'll be buying for the new quarter plus funds that were restricted from buying shares under $5 will be buying.

""Buying at the bottom is always a challenge. Many will come close but only a few will actually do so and then they will regret not having bought more shares as the share price moves higher.""

If you missed out on buying $NVDA before the run-up don't miss out on buying $SAVE before it does the same. 500% upside?

Additional points to consider:

‚úÖ $300,000,000 in cash coming.

‚úÖ All Airbus planes.

‚úÖ Expected to be cash flow positive in 2nd quarter.

Then inflation and debt caught up and once lots got packed full with those way overpriced vehicles we see what we have now.

Dealership sales only have soo much play and that they were waiting on manufacturer incentives as even 10 -15% did not budge sales, and why would they when they are still 40% too expensive with those discounts.  
  
Stubbornness means we have gone all the way through q1 with shit sales. But of course they will still manage to find a way to fuck the puts as investors know about those sales. If I had to pick one though, Id say Ford as their lightning sales have been shit since the start and their other F150's have some issues a lot seem to know about.
