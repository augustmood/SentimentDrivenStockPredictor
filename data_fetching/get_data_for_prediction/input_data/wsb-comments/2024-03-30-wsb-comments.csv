r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

First of all, there is nothing YOU can do with this certificate without a notarized or Medallion Signature Guaranteed  Third Party release from YOUR broker, completed by the registered shareholder (the name underneath the sticky note)... is this guy even the shareholder?? In addition, a stock power form that may need an MSG stamp as well signed by the registered share holder as well

Second, even if you can get this paperwork from the client with proper stamps etc, if you deposit this in your account. You are depositing one share. Not 15 shares considering the splits since issuance. One share. ONLY ONE. When these splits happen since the issuance of a stock certificate, the additional shares from a split are held in book entry form with the transfer agent under the holder's name. To get  book entry shares from the transfer agent to a broker, the holder would have to DRS the shares to the broker which contains more paperwork, approvals, stamps, whatever may be. 

This certificate will never be worth more than the price of one share of Tesla at market price, no matter how it continues to split, minus the pain and hassle of getting paperwork to make the deposit possible.... and if the transfer agent ever loses record of this certificate, gets escheated to the state, amongst other things to invalidate it, you would be SOL at that point

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else.

For example, when the us (and everyone else) was still on the gold standard around the turn of the 19th century, there was a severe shortage of gold globally. It caused a massive liquidity crunch, which greatly harmed the economic lives of the poor, especially small family farmers. When the value of money starts increasing, people hoard it, rather than spending or investing it. Poor people suffer the most when money doesn’t move around. In the us, this meant farmers couldn’t get loans to keep their farms going, or if they could the rates were usurious and they risked losing everything with one bad harvest. People who already have a lot of money do fine, but then again when don’t they really lol. 

A whole populist movement was born out of this circumstance, and a nut job called William Jennings Bryant came pretty close to being president on a single issue platform: switching from a gold to a silver standard.

The problem was only solved by a providential strike of major gold mines in South Africa, which injected a massive amount of liquidity into global markets and ended the cries for the silver standard.",,False,kx6xmtq,False,t3_1bqwxha,t1_kx6mtvm,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqwxha/powell_says_fed_doesnt_need_to_rush_interestrate/kx6xmtq/,False,1.0,False,1bqwxha,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. 

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",moderator,False,kx6zesr,False,t3_1br5br0,t3_1br5br0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br5br0/best_platforms_for_mobile_and_ira_options_trading/kx6zesr/,False,1.0,True,1br5br0,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

That means that for one piece of stock you now get 5. Obviously the price is now 1/5. Then in 2022 it split again 3:1. That means 1 \* 5 \* 3 = 15. Now this piece of paper in the image is equal to 15 Tesla stock. $175 \* 15 = $2625.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

Even in that class though, I would actually name Rupert Murdoch the real GOAT conman. Trump isn’t fooling people in a vacuum, he’s got the backing of the entire Republican establishment behind him and the most pervasive media resource available out there and all he did was shill for their ideas, I don’t think that’s really conning people, it’s just continuing the grift the GOP machinery devised decades ago.

Anyways… enough about this… I absolutely admit he’s a good conman, but he’s far from the best there’s definitely better one’s out there and even better ones in this very sub! :D

The **Strategic** Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is intended to serve as an emergency buffer to alleviate oil shortages and provide economic and national security during unexpected disruptions in oil supply. The purposes and instances when it's considered appropriate to use the reserves include:

- Supply Disruptions: The SPR can be tapped in response to significant disruptions in oil supplies, such as those caused by natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes affecting oil drilling and refining operations), geopolitical conflicts that block oil supply routes, or other global events that drastically reduce oil production.

- **Economic Stability: (PAY ATTENTION HERE. You could learn something)** Releases from the SPR can be used to counteract rising oil prices that may lead to economic instability or to prevent severe spikes in gasoline prices. By increasing the supply of oil, even temporarily, governments can help moderate fuel prices and **inflation**.

- International Obligations: Countries may decide to release oil from their reserves in coordination with other nations as part of international agreements to ensure global oil market stability. This collaborative effort can be crucial in managing global oil supply disruptions that have widespread economic implications.

- Operational Testing: Occasionally, oil may be released from the SPR to test the system's operational readiness. This ensures that the facilities and logistics for distributing the oil are functional and effective in an emergency.",,False,kx7c4g5,False,t3_1br64s9,t1_kx7acbl,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br64s9/biden_using_strategic_petroleum_reserves_to_hide/kx7c4g5/,False,16.0,False,1br64s9,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Leaving them with theoretically over 110k vehicles in inventory.  The massive list of Model Y and Model 3 available on their website  suggest inventory is high.  
>  
>Troy  Teslike is estimating <422k deliveries, meaning their inventory  increased which is not a positive. They're already reducing production,  they're using price hikes to bait Q1 buyers. I wouldn't be surprised if  their production came in at 430k on Tuesday, and closer to 400k  deliveries.  
>  
>No matter how it's  spun. The numbers are shit, there's not a lot of positive spin to it.  Even their biggest bull Dan Ives at Wedbush sound like he wants to cry  lowering the estimates.

>They're  desperately making a shift to sell software to pump up their margins.

>Johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic, as he played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry S. Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier.[128] In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil rights bill was withdrawn.[128] Believing that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.[129]

>Passing the civil rights bill in the House required getting it through the Rules Committee, which had been attempting to kill it. Johnson used a discharge petition to force it onto the House floor

The **Strategic** Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is intended to serve as an emergency buffer to alleviate oil shortages and provide economic and national security during unexpected disruptions in oil supply. The purposes and instances when it's considered appropriate to use the reserves include:

* Supply Disruptions: The SPR can be tapped in response to significant disruptions in oil supplies, such as those caused by natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes affecting oil drilling and refining operations), geopolitical conflicts that block oil supply routes, or other global events that drastically reduce oil production.
* **Economic Stability: (PAY ATTENTION HERE. You could learn something)** Releases from the SPR can be used to counteract rising oil prices that may lead to economic instability or to prevent severe spikes in gasoline prices. By increasing the supply of oil, even temporarily, governments can help moderate fuel prices and **inflation**.
* International Obligations: Countries may decide to release oil from their reserves in coordination with other nations as part of international agreements to ensure global oil market stability. This collaborative effort can be crucial in managing global oil supply disruptions that have widespread economic implications.
* Operational Testing: Occasionally, oil may be released from the SPR to test the system's operational readiness. This ensures that the facilities and logistics for distributing the oil are functional and effective in an emergency.",,False,kx7ic5j,False,t3_1br64s9,t3_1br64s9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br64s9/biden_using_strategic_petroleum_reserves_to_hide/kx7ic5j/,False,4.0,False,1br64s9,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Ok dude, when did the value of housing shrink to zero during that period? Draw the trend like for housing value in the 20th century. Did your pencil go up or down?

And ofc lowering interest rates increases prices of everything! That’s the basic mechanics of how interest rates work. For housing prices going higher, you can add on the 30 year fixed mortgage and other govt backed products as causes of long term inflation of housing prices. So what?  Why is it bad if prices go up, provided wages do too? And btw, the flattening of middle class wages that started in the 1980s happened to coincide with a period of super high interest rates, which we were told were needed to tame inflation and keep everything affordable haha. 


And anyway, how does any of this get back to your original idea that deflation would be good for the average Joe? If the value of a dollar keeps increasing over time, wages will fall too. And if i take out your 10 year loan at 15%, you can’t just calculate the nominal value of dollars accrued over the life of the loan, you have to adjust for your deflation. Those payments in years 5-10 are gonna just get increasingly brutal, especially alongside your ever shrinking salary. In an inflationary environment, the cost of those payments in real dollars shrinks over time, while your wages will continue to rise. The 30 year fixed loans has definitely caused the value of housing to inflate, but it’s also been a great source of wealth creation and stability for middle class Americans. 

That said, of course too much inflation is a bad thing. And id agree with you that the fed should have started raising rates around 2016. And that they went too far with both rates and money printing during covid. But none of that means we should hope for a normalization of deflation, it’d crush anyone who has to work for a living.",,False,kx7mgtb,False,t3_1bqwxha,t1_kx7gw7y,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqwxha/powell_says_fed_doesnt_need_to_rush_interestrate/kx7mgtb/,False,1.0,False,1bqwxha,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-03-30 04:59:49+00:00,1711774789.0,Puzzleheaded_Spot401,"Correct, you are just selling the contract you own.

He's referring to selling a contract. When you write an options contract you are obligated to either sell the underlying stick at the strike price in the case of a call or buy it at the strike price in the case of a put. 

So if you sell a call contract on Tesla at a strike price of $200 without owning any shares of Tesla, then it's considered naked because you don't have the means to satisfy the contract if the price rises above $200.

If you owned 100 shares of Tesla, you'd sell them at $200 as agreed in the call contract you wrote. That's why the buyer paid you the premium or cost of the call. 

If you only sold one naked contract and the price rises to $210, then you'd owe $10 for every share in the contract, so you'd owe $1,000 because each contract represents 100 shares (although you have to consider that you also made money off the premiums or price of the contract you sold).

If Tesla goes to $1,000 then you owe $800 for every share, so $800 x 100, so $80k. 

Or if you sell 10 contracts and the price goes up by 10, then you owe 100x10x$10 or $10k.

The less expensive way to deal with this is to buy call contracts that will cap off or cover your losses.

So you'd sell expensive contracts at the $200 strike but you'd buy less expensive contracts at the $201 strike. This way your max loss is the difference between the contracts strike price or $1 x 100 shares.

If you were bullish, but broke, you could buy at the $200 then offset the cost of that purchase by selling at the cheaper $201 strike price, but that limits the max you make to $100 it $1 per share.

This is basically what OP did, but the broker has only executed the $201 strike contracts that they sold so if the hypothetical price went to $280 then it looks like they owe $79 per share x the number of contracts they sold; however, they're actually fine because of the contracts they have bought at either a higher or lower strike price.

OP is covered and just has to wait for all the contracts to be executed.",,False,kx7r9gq,False,t3_1bqu5g0,t1_kx6yepj,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqu5g0/anyone_ever_gotten_this/kx7r9gq/,False,1.0,False,1bqu5g0,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

HBM is die intensive: meaning a single 32GB HBM3e module has the equivalent die consumption as 8x 36GB DDR5 RDIMM modules. If you extrapolate that to Blackwell, it has 576GB of ""Micron"" HBM3e in each GPU - and the whole GB200 NvLink server has a total of 30TB of HBM3 (GB200 has a staggering 1.4 exflops - which is 1.4 quintillions of floating-point operations per second - absolutely staggering, but I digress). Hynix do not yet have HBM3e capability but they are catching up but Micron is already testing HBM4 which is even more silicon intensive. 

What this means is: dies are being used up for HBM builds in large quantities, thereby throttling supplies to ""day job"" customers such as mobile phones, laptops, devices, autos, etc. This will create the price bump you are talking about in normal memory products for the foreseeable future, despite no increases to DRAM or NAND TAM. 

Last point is: end users are also acutely aware of the memory price cycles. Which is why when memory prices hit rock bottom at the beginning of 2023, your iPhone still cost the same, if not more. This is because end users of memory (companies like Apple or Dell) dont pass on savings from low prices to the customers as they know then when the market turns, they have to absorb the price increases.",,False,kx7thi1,False,t3_1bpn14k,t1_kwyvd15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bpn14k/forget_chips_storage_is_the_play_mu/kx7thi1/,False,2.0,False,1bpn14k,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

However, significant progress is being made in AI-assisted code optimization.  Future advancements in machine learning could theoretically lead to AI that can modify its own code in an iterative and efficient way.*

I thought this was interesting when asking AI if it could rewrite itself into the most efficient version with its ability to code. Also, I didn't know they couldn't actually write in straight machine language, but needed 'human-written' languages like Python, Java, etc. 

At some point, this timeline should see capex spend on datacenters and chips reduce drastically as AI will rewrite itself to better than human imagination. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)",,False,kx8anc8,False,t3_1bqy544,t3_1bqy544,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqy544/weekend_discussion_thread_for_march_29_2024/kx8anc8/,False,1.0,False,1bqy544,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-03-30 09:39:30+00:00,1711791570.0,shrimpgangsta,"""LOL no. I process stock certificates. Please read carefully

First of all, there is nothing YOU can do with this certificate without a notarized or Medallion Signature Guaranteed  Third Party release from YOUR broker, completed by the registered shareholder (the name underneath the sticky note)... is this guy even the shareholder?? In addition, a stock power form that may need an MSG stamp as well signed by the registered share holder as well

Second, even if you can get this paperwork from the client with proper stamps etc, if you deposit this in your account. You are depositing one share. Not 15 shares considering the splits since issuance. One share. ONLY ONE. When these splits happen since the issuance of a stock certificate, the additional shares from a split are held in book entry form with the transfer agent under the holder's name. To get  book entry shares from the transfer agent to a broker, the holder would have to DRS the shares to the broker which contains more paperwork, approvals, stamps, whatever may be.

This certificate will never be worth more than the price of one share of Tesla at market price, no matter how it continues to split, minus the pain and hassle of getting paperwork to make the deposit possible.... and if the transfer agent ever loses record of this certificate, gets escheated to the state, amongst other things to invalidate it, you would be SOL at that point

This is definitely scam of some sort. Trust me""

(i try to remember to never believe anything i see or read on tv or on internet articles).  so, make sure to research the story yourself.  if the story is true (which it it sure seems like it might be) then it should be easy to find.  (there...  so now, robinhood cannot accuse me of any kind of slander or shit talking their company name, because i just said that i am not positive on the teuth to tiis story.  you need to do the checking for yourself).

anyway...  i am assuming that your pic, is from a robinhood account.  and this story i read took place about 2 or so years ago.

there was some kid (maybe 18 years old) that wound up with a similar message.  i don't remember the details, but i think i remember that the kids parents didn't know he was trading at all.

well, when he got a similar type message, he had no idea how it happenned.  he thought he had ruined his and his family's lives.

the only wat for him to contact whichever platform he was using, was through an email type message service - that had maybe a 1 to 3-day response time.

unfortunately, that was too long of a wait  vs.  this kids distraught confusion.  so, he wound up killing himself.  (moment of silence).

and, if that isn't bad enough for ya...

his message was responded to by the next day (or maybe the day after) saying that this was a common message to see, but was not true.  it had something to do with the way their system recalculated / reset accounts, and it would cause this EXACT same type of message to show-up for only a short while.

so, if that poor kid could have held out for just 1 or 2 more days, then he would have seen that everything automatically self corrected itself about 2 days later (which i think it did).  just a bit too late.  and the kids correct values displayed.  values that were FAR FAR away from a similar value as seen in your message. 

after reading that, i have always wondered why ""whatever company"" it was, would even allow a message like that to freak the fuck out of people.  they could have made it so such messages would NOT DISPLAY!

so, i am guessing you are just fine.  and, it will show the correct values in a day or two.  but still, it never hurts to contact the platform.  BUT...  wait until you hear their reply before acting on any harmful impulse.

good luck.  even though i don't think you'll be needing it.   🤙",,False,kx8f0on,False,t3_1bqu5g0,t3_1bqu5g0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqu5g0/anyone_ever_gotten_this/kx8f0on/,False,1.0,False,1bqu5g0,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Watts aren't how energy is measured for households. Instead, kilowatt hours (kWH) are used. One kilowatt hour is the same as 1000 watts running for one hour, so 1200 watts use 1.2 kWH in an hour or 28.8 kWH in a day, right around the US household average. So, at 1200 W, a single chip does use about as much power as a US household if it's running all day.

However, Huang said 2,000 Blackwell GPUs would use 4 megawatts of power, compared to 8,000 older GPUs at 15 megawatts of power. I'm assuming he's talking about the liquid cooled Blackwell chips in his example, which are more energy intensive than the 1200 W GPUs.

That's 2 kW per GPU and 48 kWH per gpu per day. For 2000 GPUs, thats 400,000 W, 96,000 kWH, or 96 MWH per day. That's much, much more than the US average household to run his example. It's also way better than what they had before, so yay for improvements.

Trying to figure this out explained to me why my mom had such high power bills with two 800 watt computers, multiple TVs connected to PS3 and PS4s, and two 1500W air conditioners, one which my brother ran 24/7. My sister ran a space heater every season except for summer as well.

-Keep the price from jumping to limit Russia’s oil revenue. 


…is just plain old good stewardship of our resources and the economy itself.

These goals (stabilize inflation, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, generate jobs thru IRA, pull EU allies back from dependence on Russian fuel, generate revenue for U.S. at the expense of Russia) all further US strategic interests — and they overlap and reinforce each other.

The blend of _major strategic_ benefits all make for a wonderful reason to tap the _strategic_ reserve.

The last time we destroy the fucking WallStreet, but today we have an opportunity: SAS (SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES SYSTEM) I think that is a very very good moment to invest.

Why?

Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was almost going bankrupt, but guess what? They turned the tables! They managed to cut down their losses to 136 million, which is a huge improvement from before. And get this, SkyTeam just swooped in and grabbed a 19% stake in the company. How cool is that? Looks like SAS is getting back on its feet after the whole crisis thing. And you know what's even more exciting? The stock is trading at just 3 cents a share right now and you can take 1000 stock with 10$. That's practically a steal! With SkyTeam betting big on them, it seems like there's a massive opportunity to make some serious cash here. Who knows, in the long run, we might see those shares shooting up!

Given SAS's recent turnaround and the potential for growth, I wouldn't be surprised if investment funds are eyeing it up. I mean, think about it - with the company making strides to recover, coupled with SkyTeam's significant investment, it's looking like a pretty attractive opportunity for investors. Plus, the low stock price right now could be seen as a golden opportunity for funds to get in early before any potential surge in value. So yeah, I wouldn't be shocked if we see some investment funds hopping on the SAS train soon!

so (to re-sum things up) i am close to 100% sure that this will correct itself in a day or two.

just search for an article from about 2 years ago  -  where some young kid got a similar message  -  thought he ruined his and his family's life  -  and was not able to contact customer service immediately because of their SLOW email type message system.

the poor kid ended up committing suicide before the customer service department answered him (sometime within the next 2 days).

they company said this type of message could be ignored.  it had something to do with a ""timed reset of account values"" or something.

so, everything corrected itself automatically, about a day or so later.  but still...  too late.

impo...  i think it is a giant load of B.S. that any company would even let these type of messages populate.  sometimes it is necessary  (if you are already a near millionaire and like to gamble big).

but for those with nowhere near that much in the account to begin with...  they should make sure these idiotic messages are filtered out, when they are UNNECESSARY.

anyway...  i am guessing that you are just fine.  and all totals will be accurate by tomorrow or the next day.

and...  never hurts to message them.  or, i think certain platforms now have a phone number - or at least - a quick response message system.",,False,kx8hcuv,False,t3_1bqu5g0,t3_1bqu5g0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqu5g0/anyone_ever_gotten_this/kx8hcuv/,False,1.0,False,1bqu5g0,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

And on the other end, you have same members of UN screaming bloody murder when some other UN member country goes and do something for which they themselves set a precedent. 

Bombing of Yugoslavia was the first time NATO forces were used outside of their initial intention: to be a defensive force for all of it's members. If I recall correctly, Yugoslavia, nor it's province Kosovo, weren't a part of NATO at the time. But Yugoslavia was a member of UN (and a founding memeber, at that). And now, Yugoslavia is no more. There is a long list of reasons why it ceased to exist. Bombing isn't the only one. A lot of the reasons were internal ones that stem from the begining of XX century, but it was definitely one of the nails in the coffin.

Thinking in ""black-and-white"" terms has no place in international politics, so ""US good, China/Russia bad"" stance that u/AmbitiousEconomics was presenting only shows the lack of understanding of political and historical context. In any case, I wish them well.

The last time we destroy the fucking WallStreet, but today we have an opportunity: SAS (SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES SYSTEM) I think that is a very very good moment to invest.

Why?

Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was almost going bankrupt, but guess what? They turned the tables! They managed to cut down their losses to 136 million, which is a huge improvement from before. And get this, SkyTeam just swooped in and grabbed a 19% stake in the company. How cool is that? Looks like SAS is getting back on its feet after the whole crisis thing. And you know what's even more exciting? The stock is trading at just 3 cents a share right now and you can take 1000 stock with 10$. That's practically a steal! With SkyTeam betting big on them, it seems like there's a massive opportunity to make some serious cash here. Who knows, in the long run, we might see those shares shooting up!

Given SAS's recent turnaround and the potential for growth, I wouldn't be surprised if investment funds are eyeing it up. I mean, think about it - with the company making strides to recover, coupled with SkyTeam's significant investment, it's looking like a pretty attractive opportunity for investors. Plus, the low stock price right now could be seen as a golden opportunity for funds to get in early before any potential surge in value. So yeah, I wouldn't be shocked if we see some investment funds hopping on the SAS train soon!

Now is the moment

And you know what's even more exciting? The stock is trading at just 3 cents a share right now and you can take 1000 stock with 10$. That's practically a steal! With SkyTeam betting big on them, it seems like there's a massive opportunity to make some serious cash here. Who knows, in the long run, we might see those shares shooting up!

Given SAS's recent turnaround and the potential for growth, I wouldn't be surprised if investment funds are eyeing it up. I mean, think about it - with the company making strides to recover, coupled with SkyTeam's significant investment, it's looking like a pretty attractive opportunity for investors. Plus, the low stock price right now could be seen as a golden opportunity for funds to get in early before any potential surge in value. So yeah, I wouldn't be shocked if we see some investment funds hopping on the SAS train soon!

How do humans do math? They just follow rules and crunch the numbers. An AI, which IS a tool, does the same thing, but much better because it has more memory and processing power for numbers. 

Intelligence: the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

That's all it is. Tools have this ability. That's what AI is. If I can train an AI to understand like maps, and I request it to show me Berlin Germany, and it does it in an instant, that's an AI intelligently finding Berlin Germany on a map and showing it to me. 

If I train an AI to play chess, and it gets really really good at it, and starts designing new novel ways to play, how's that not intelligent? How's that any different than a human? The only difference is it's intelligence is linear and specific rather than broad and general.

Boxing is whatever, and not fully applicable. Muay thai is great if you want to learn striking and all, but it too will take quite a toll on your body. Judo is amazing, especially because take down’s can decide fights instantly, but it’s a serious banger on your hips, and knees. Depending on your resolve, ignore the hurt potential warnings. You have to turn that pain and aches into tuition payments as a mindset.

It’s always good to diversify, and take two forms when you’re ready. I just always recommend to start one, get used to it, be consistent, and it’ll open your doors to your next path. 

I recommend Jiu Jutsu/BJJ to start because it’s such a huge eye opener to your vulnerability. Most good gyms have a family like bond that’ll make you feel like you really belong, and are respected.

Interestingly I’ve found that I’m right about whether to buy calls or puts the majority of the time, but due to the Greeks and the fact that it’s hard to know when to buy and when to sell I still usually lose.
For example I might get a couple OTM calls on a stock that expires in 5 days, but I often paperhand it after only holding a couple days and taking losses due to theta. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve taken a loss just because I chickened out. 
Another common scenario is that my options actually are ITM at one point during the week but I get cocky and don’t take the win, resulting in a loss a few days later. 
So I would say my ability to predict which way a stock is going to go and how far is right probably 60-70% of the time, but figuring out when to buy and when to sell is almost impossible with the high-risk plays I always gravitate to.",,False,kx8qo80,False,t3_1brehmf,t3_1brehmf,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brehmf/what_is_your_win_rate/kx8qo80/,False,2.0,False,1brehmf,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-03-30 12:21:30+00:00,1711801290.0,MegaDonkeyKong666,"Based on the information gathered from various sources, here is an analysis of Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A. (Ticker: NWRN), listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.  

Fundamentals: 

Company Overview: Newron Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development of novel therapies for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and pain. Its key product is Xadago (safinamide) for Parkinson’s disease treatment, with a pipeline including Evenamide for schizophrenia.  

Financial Performance:   

The company has experienced significant share price volatility over the past three months. Notably, it has a negative shareholders equity and less than a year of cash runway, indicating potential liquidity risks. Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.  

Performance: Over the past year, NWRN's share price has increased by 20%, with a three-year change of 156.55%. However, it has seen a decline of 10.58% over the last five years. The company's market cap is approximately CHF 138.62 million.  

Risks:  

Analysts note the highly volatile share price, the risk of shareholder dilution, and financial sustainability concerns due to less than a year of cash runway.  

Price Fluctuations:  

The share price currently stands at CHF 7.44, having decreased by 4.86% at the last close. The 52-week price range is CHF 3.70 - CHF 10.80.  

Volume and Volatility: The average trading volume is 155,098, with recent trading sessions witnessing volumes of 72,755. The stock has shown a beta of 0.73 over the past five years, indicating relatively moderate volatility in comparison to the market.  

Recent Corporate Developments:  

Newron appointed Margarita Chavez as a new non-executive director, bringing over two decades of pharmaceutical industry expertise and leadership. Her experience spans dealmaking, investments, and company-building across the US and Europe, which could provide Newron with strategic advantages in advancing their drug development and commercialization efforts .   

Latest Updates on Evenamide:  

Newron reported encouraging interim results from a study on Evenamide, showing substantial improvement in patients with moderate to severe TRS. These patients were not responding to their current antipsychotic medication. The study revealed that after six months of treatment with Evenamide, there was a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in TRS symptoms.  


The clinical trial, which involved 161 subjects, demonstrated Evenamide’s potential as a meaningful treatment for TRS, a condition that affects about one-third of schizophrenia patients and is characterized by a lack of response to conventional antipsychotics. This underscores the dire need for new therapeutic options  .  


Evenamide works by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and normalizing glutamate release without affecting other CNS targets. This mechanism could offer a novel approach for TRS treatment, differing from current antipsychotics that primarily target dopaminergic neurotransmission .  

Looking Forward:  


Newron is planning a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled study to further evaluate Evenamide’s efficacy in TRS patients. This next phase in Evenamide’s clinical development will be crucial for its approval as a new treatment option for schizophrenia, particularly for those patients who are resistant to existing therapies.   

Loan Extensions:  

The announcement that Newron Pharmaceuticals has obtained an extension on three near-term tranche repayment dates under its 2018 financing agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) carries significant implications for the company’s financial health and strategic flexibility. This development is especially relevant for investors and stakeholders tracking the company’s fiscal management and growth prospects. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects and potential implications:

Immediate Financial Relief

By deferring the due dates of the first three tranches from June 2024 to dates spanning from November 2025 to June 2026, Newron Pharmaceuticals alleviates immediate cash outflow pressures. This delay in repayment provides the company with enhanced liquidity over the short to medium term, which is crucial for its operational and research & development activities.

Implications for Cash Flow Management

This extension allows Newron to better manage its cash flow, potentially dedicating a greater portion of its resources to critical areas such as drug development, clinical trials, and market expansion efforts. For a biopharmaceutical company, the ability to sustain investment in these areas is vital for long-term success, especially when developing new therapies or bringing them to market.

Investor Confidence and Market Perception

Such financial negotiations and outcomes can also impact investor confidence and market perception. Successfully renegotiating loan terms may be viewed positively by the market, signaling confidence from creditors in the company’s future prospects. However, the need for such extensions might also raise questions about the company’s current cash burn rate and financial stability.

Strategic Flexibility

The rescheduling provides Newron with increased strategic flexibility. With more breathing room financially, the company might be in a better position to pursue strategic partnerships, collaborations, or further investment in its pipeline without the immediate pressure of substantial loan repayments.

Future Financial Strategy

While the immediate repayment pressure is alleviated, the company will still need to address these liabilities in the future, alongside the remaining two tranches on their original due dates. This necessitates prudent financial strategy and planning to ensure that the company remains on a stable financial footing when these obligations come due.

Overall Outlook

This development is a mixed signal. On one hand, it provides Newron Pharmaceuticals with immediate financial relief and more room to maneuver strategically. On the other hand, it underscores the ongoing financial challenges the company faces, necessitating careful monitoring of its financial health and operational efficiency moving forward.

Investors and stakeholders should closely follow Newron Pharmaceuticals’ subsequent financial reports and updates for further insights into how this extension might affect the company’s financial strategies and overall trajectory.",,False,kx8sr07,False,t3_1br9ufg,t3_1br9ufg,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br9ufg/below_fair_value_nwrn_chf776_is_trading_below_our/kx8sr07/,False,1.0,False,1br9ufg,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-03-30 12:33:08+00:00,1711801988.0,DeluxeSSG,"This simply just...depends. 

Some issuers have paperwork set up with the transfer agent called a Letter of Transmittal to aid in converting stock certificates from reverse splits or funky split rates from mergers. This would have been paperwork that was mailed to you from the transfer agent. 

What is tricky is, not many issuers/transfer agents go about this that way. Some transfer agents require that this paperwork be completed, some don't require any additional paperwork from the shareholder and maybe just some extra handling from the broker. Some times right at the time of the reorg or merger, the certificates automatically get converted to its new equivalent in book entry at the transfer agent. But if the client has to do legwork themselves in those regards, but a good chunk of time passes without any action taken, the certificate may be eschated to the state. Frankly, my broker won't even touch a certificate with a corporate action over 10 years old (unless it's just a name change) because they are almost never valid 

My suggestion is either:
1. to contact your broker to see if they have the capacity to research and solve all of these mysteries for you to tell you if it is valid, acceptable for custody at said broker, and if anything additional is needed. Not every broker will do this, some will ask you to mail it in to them to process and they would tell you from there

The resulting total net petroleum imports (imports minus exports) were about -1.64 million b/d, which means that the United States was a net petroleum exporter of 1.64 million b/d in 2023.

>""Data from the Bureau of Land Management shows that President Biden approved more oil and gas drilling permits in his first two years in office than former President Donald Trump. From Jan. 20, 2021, to Jan. 19 of 2023 the BLM [approved 6,430 permits for oil or gas drilling on federal land](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/QJwGd), compared with 6,172 drilling permits approved during the first two years of the Trump administration.""

This is true, but it's also bullshit and not what I said.  To drill you need permits and leases.  He has been approving permits but pulling leases to trick low information people like you.  Then people like you spread around the propaganda that he's doing everything he can and it's just those greedy big oil guys that are raising prices.  Like I said earlier,  it takes about 10 years to get the approvals and equipment set up to start drilling at a new site.  By pulling leases of, at the time, ongoing drill sites he destroyed these companies investments.  Even if Trump were to get back in and approve them, it would take some time to set up and they could just be pulled again.  Why waste the millions to set up again for something that will be taken from you the second a new Democrat takes over?  He also is trying to kill the oil industry but switching to all electric.  Why would you ever lower your prices below market rate in this situation?  If I were these companies I would produce like crazy while I can before the next idiotic Democrat gets in and kills your business.

I was a little hyperbolic by saying it became a net importer when Biden took office and we still aren't.  While it was true, we did drop below the threshold, he did pick it up back towards the end of 2021.  Probably due to the sky high inflation largely fueled by his handouts and war on the oil industry raising gas prices.",,False,kx934jl,False,t3_1br64s9,t1_kx8xjs7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1br64s9/biden_using_strategic_petroleum_reserves_to_hide/kx934jl/,False,-2.0,False,1br64s9,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

If you flip it 100 times, it still wouldn't be *that* crazy to get, say, 70/30. But if you flipped it 1m times, you'd start approaching much, much closer to 50/50.

do you really believe that the government CPI inflation numbers at 3% is accurate? [shadowstats.com](http://shadowstats.com) states we are currently around 7-8% (calculating inflation the way they did in the 80's). what do you think will happen if the FED cuts interest rates when inflation is already high? keep in mind this is all against the backdrop of record levels of deficit spending, something like $1Trillion every 100 days now

do you really think the politicians are going to do the right thing and allow a major crash to happen so we get price deflation? or will they do what they have done every other time in modern history, which is a monetary reset. basically just increasing the price of gold and other assets higher to rebalance everything at a higher level. why do you think gold is breaking out into new all time high's?

what do you think happens if the conflicts in the middle east escalate? what happens if Iran is really drawn into this war beyond just supporting their proxies as they are doing now? you dont think the first thing that will happen is the closure of the strait of hormuz, where approx 1/3 of the world's oil flows out of?

>Biden has pulled leases that were/are in environmentally sensitive areas and other leases that the oil companies had no plans to use.

Why do they have no plans to use them?  Why would you pull a lease because they don't have plans to use them?  Why wouldn't you just give it to someone else that plans on using it?

>The intention is to make sure competitors don’t get them while they wait for energy prices to climb high enough to make it even more profitable.

So Biden's solution is to pull the lease so no one can use it?

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is >500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

- he is not prematurely cutting rates
- he is saying higher for longer may be the theme, which the market knew

If your post essentially boils down to trying to recruit others to buy into your stock so that it can squeeze, then your post is not welcome here.

The truth is, we get a lot of ""squeeze plays"" or ""the next GME"" type threads, and honestly, they never pan out.

If you really have an interesting play, it should be able to stand on its own merits, without necessitating a whole bunch of retailers (kek) to buy in after you and pump up the price.

Look, this isn't a pump and dump forum. For that, try r/ponzischemes.

But if we're talking about ""luck"" which is *beating* the odds, doing it *a lot of times* is less likely than doing it a *small amount* of times.

True to form, idiotic American consumers are barking up the wrong tree. Instead of going after the hedge funds who are paying cash and actually causing the commoditization of American homes, they are going after their best advocates. Absolutely idiotic.

I think buyers should represent themselves for at least one transaction. After they get chewed up and spit out by the listing agent or discover after escrow that a serious defect wasn't disclosed they can hire a lawyer to sort things out. Then offer a discounted fee to that attorney and see how that all works out in the end.",,False,kx9c1kx,False,t3_1brgj1a,t1_kx9984u,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brgj1a/the_realtors_settlement_is_already_changing_the/kx9c1kx/,False,1.0,False,1brgj1a,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Then, the price is not tied to fundamentals at all. Everyone knows this, but no one knows when the bottom will fall out. In order to short this, you need a margin account. My online broker requires 300% of your position in cash in your margin account. Normally, this is only 30-40%.

I suggest a) being calmer, but firm, and b) if you can’t, or if it’s going nowhere with the person, then HUACA - hang up and call again. Just end the session. No need to say goodbye, no need to say anything, just click.

You might thing that’s all silly, but consider. What do you really want? An answer to your problem? Or to yell at some random person. If the latter, then you’re doing great and continue as you are. If the former, start realizing that your way of interacting not only isn’t good for all the reasons you don’t care about, but it actually hurts your chances lol.

You’re the one acting like an idiot. My friend regularly has companies break rules for him. He learns their shit, reads it better than they do, and will keep engaging support, keep firmly not letting shit drop, and never giving up (but also just hanging up and calling again).

I’m telling you, it’s fucking insane the kinda of things I’ve seen him get undone. Seriously. Save the disrespect for the victory dinner where you’re telling your friends.

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is >500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

“The long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling – and in some cases, restricting – how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth’s products and services.”

Basically this is a problem because they are locking people into their products with their ecosystem/ vertical integration making it hard to switch to a competitor. Then once their locked in they start charging $1400 for something that cost a fraction of the price. This is monopolistic behavior which is bad for consumers because their not competing on the merits of their product but just making it harder to use a competitor and jacking up prices.",,False,kxai6q3,False,t3_1bro25i,t1_kxagy37,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bro25i/ozempic_maker_novo_nordisk_facing_pressure_as/kxai6q3/,False,1.0,False,1bro25i,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

The USA bafflingly does not negotiate despite its immense leverage. This is due to corporate lobbying and the idea that it will stifle innovation and cut funds for R&D, which is of course true in part, but used as a crutch to protect their ability to price gouge. 

All in all though in think anyone who invests in pharma companies knows that even with the USA market they’re not as profitable as Internet commentators will have you believe. Profits mostly come from a few winners. The blockbuster drugs usually last about 10 years (20 year patent minus ~10 years of trials). It’s true that drug development and trials are extremely expensive.

This includes funding and running human trials, which often fail.   In addition, it takes about 10 years to bring a drug to market, this is significant time investment.

Second, the historical data a broker shows you is not necessarily the same as the live prices on which stop orders are conditioned. For example, a broker might source their historical data feed from a data provider that uses OPRA quotes, but the broker might send orders to a liquidity provider that conditions stop orders on last traded price. Or it could be vice versa. One could be based on mid price and the other on bid/ask (depending on the order) or on a size weighted mark. Historical quote data can also be imperfect, especially at market open and close.

As a result, it’s common for stop orders to look like they triggered a few cents off the trigger price.

The high prices are being used as evidence that harm is being caused to consumers. 

But the lawsuit is over their anticompetitive practices. 

If Apple wanted to change things at an egregious markup, they'd be free to do so, if there was viable competition.

Also, the high prices aren't really about the hardware. They're mainly about the cut Apple takes on the App Store of any revenue your app generates. The ""consumers"" in this case are companies selling through the app store, not people buying phones.

To be in the app store, 30% of revenue gets taken by apple. So it is extremely difficult to start a business in America, because Apple controls half the phone market. 

On top of that, Apple provides competitive products that are not subject to that 30% revenue cut (think Apple Music vs Spotify, for example)

So Spotify is forced to charge more for their service than Apple charges, because of Apples monopoly power. Hence, consumers of Spotify paying a higher price indirectly.

Spotify doesn't have a 2-tier pricing system. That would hurt it's brand, so Android subscribers to Spotify are likely subsidizing some of the difference. So apples monopoly is also impacting consumers who specifically don't buy Apple products.

Hence the lawsuit.

Believing workers should never be allowed to have their dollar be worth more is cuck logic. 
Your dollar is simply worth more (you gain value from the exponential increase in productivity and efficiency), or it’s devalued to prevent you from ever seeing any of that surplus value.

I agree 100% with you guys that All the fancy ways they manipulate the currency screws people over , regardless if during their definition of in/deflation. 

End of the day it’s black or white to me until the data shows otherwise, if a currency isn’t manipulated, and productivity/efficiency is going up, that currency should become worth more. Items should be cheaper, not more expensive. 
Quite frankly this reminds me a lot of the 2021 inflation where we quite literally saw 20% inflation, but idiots got a 1-2k pay raise and we’re super happy. The classic “but look, a higher wage regard!!!, ignore the part that it’s actually worth less. 

Here’s my classic example, tell someone “there’s been 35% inflation since 2020”, they’ll just be like oh neat, end of story. Now tell them what they would think If they gov decided to take 35% of all their savings, and lower all future earnings of theirs by 35% (is quite literally what is happening, just worded in a different way they’ll understand it affects them).

2024-03-30 20:00:31+00:00,1711828831.0,JGWol,"Apple can have the same wave of speculation come into their stock if they can do the following;

1.	⁠most important, seamlessly integrate AI services (free and paid) into the next iOS. Enterprise use for stream lining creation of art, scripting, programming, video creation. Apple has always had a reputation of being the go to for artistic development. They are perfectly positioned to leverage AI tools to suit their circle of known competence.
2.	⁠Cater the Vision AR to enterprise until the form factor is enough for casual consumers to utilize it in a way that is not going to make them stick out like a sore thumb.

as it is, the Vision Pro is cool, and has utility. AR software is certainly still in its infancy. The fact is there are certainly use cases for it that many of us can’t conceptualize. But the moment it’s proven to be a need-to-own asset for the likes of doctors, engineers and programmers, it expands apples moat. And the enterprise use helps to finance R&D of shrinking the dimensions for a casual edition. Apple needs to get the pro down to the size of a pair of glasses. META and Apple are not dumb. They will not and should not give up on AR development. When it becomes as convenient to enable AR as it is to put in a pair of AirPods or slip on your Apple Watch, and you can do so for $1500-2000, it will sell millions of units a quarter.

3) Buyback shares. Billions of shares. Apple has been doing so since 2012, and to date has bought back $50b worth of shares. But if they can afford it, they need to announce they are doubling down on repurchasing stock. 15b float is crazy. Consider NVDA has nearly the market cap of Apple with only 2.5b shares. If Apple wants to get its stock up to the 250-300 range, they need to buy back another 3-4 billion shares.

The fact is 65% of those 15b shares are owned by institutions and insiders. This gives Apple an insane amount of support. But again, so much float makes the stock very slow to move. Taking another 10% of shares away from retail would help expand volatility upwards.",,False,kxar0xs,False,t3_1blqeqo,t3_1blqeqo,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blqeqo/craapl_is_a_buy_the_ai_bull_market_is_only/kxar0xs/,False,1.0,False,1blqeqo,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

And it seeps out of the pores of more than half the doctors I've ever met. Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of dollars and a decade of schooling, yet me, a medical field hobbyist, constantly cringes hard at the unprofessionalism and incompetence of so many doctors.  
  
Despite being constantly wrong on some of the most basic stuff, these people have an air of arrogance about them that outcompetes any other profession I know of. All because they get paid 6 figures and they're too stupid to know they actually don't provide a lot of value.  
  
I know people that live in the Florida Keyes and makes 6 figures cleaning dental tools. 15$ for a Tylenol in the ER and I'm sure that's because it has to be name brand so it doesn't have that +-10% variation allowed in generics, plus the certified professional that has to grab it from the quarter million dollar storage unit and because of the triple certified medical professional that has to spend 20 minutes inspecting the pill for defects right?  
  
Nope, it's just a fucking pill, probably name brand Tylenol which got a contract with the hospital for taking out one of the board members on a private jet to some all exclusive resort with hookers and blow, stored in a 700$ cabinet taking up one one millionth the hospitals space, retrieved out by some LPN in less than a minute.

On the remodels, you wouldn't believe the amount of people that come up to the store looking to buy coffee. Construction work going on everywhere, banners saying the store is closed, dumpster directly in front of the building filled with trash, it's a construction site right - and these coffee addicted fuckers will walk through all of that up to the door and peep their head in to a completely destroyed torn up space and ask, ""are you guys open?"". Lady, there isn't even a fucking floor in this place right now let alone a coffee machine no it's not open.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

A MACD (and most other indicators) are only useful AFTER the event happens. It's useless.

Look at that post above and ""buy at the bullish cross over and sell at the bearish cross overs"". You would have lost money.

I can show you 10 indicators that show this is going higher, and 10 indicators that are showing this is going lower.

People like to pick the ones that go along with their personal beliefs.

If spy goes up, we'll never hear from this guy again. If it goes down, he'll say ""I told ya so"".

In the end, if you believe you can predict the market (a trillion dollar skill), based on a single, free, indicator. Than you're the fool.

I do believe the market is over bought right now, and is due for a pull back. When that MACD crosses bearish (either this week, or a month from now), there's a good chance it will be a bad time to sell.

While you're out there selling on that cross as you think it's the start of a negative trend, thousands are out there using it as a buying opportunity they have been waiting for. If it will actually go bearish or not is based on a million other factors that a MACD indicator can't see.

TLDR: using that picture above, the MACD would have lost you money. It's a useless indicator on its own as it is reactive and not predictive. Stock market may go up or down and thinking you can predict that with a free indicator is dumb.",,1711831090.0,kxawlx2,False,t3_1brqony,t1_kxarioy,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brqony/quick_question_if_everyone_is_bullish_this_week/kxawlx2/,False,2.0,False,1brqony,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

This is due to corporate lobbying and the idea that it will stifle innovation and cut funds for R&D, which is of course true in part, but used as a crutch to protect their ability to price gouge.


It isn't price gouging when you're in the hole for hundreds of millions, if not billions, for a single drug and have a set amount of years before the patent expires. 10 years is not a long time. 

Your anger should be directed towards other countries who allow the U.S. to subsidize drug companies while they negotiate prices to be a fraction of what they charge the U.S. market. As with many things, foreign markets get a free ride while the U.S. pays for the R&D costs.

January was bad and February is not looking great either, but there are reasons and super wishful thinking on my part.

First, January had most of their hashrate down due to storms that knocked out their power infrastructure.

Second, that infrastructure was repaired (and hopefully upgraded to prevent future storm outages), and I am assuming they upgraded all their machines with new firmware that they just released for sale.

Lastly, the current rates are priced in.  (this is the wishful thinking part)  I am hoping they used their machines for other tasks or maybe mined a different pool for a while.

Don't ever forget that if you can rightfully and accurately predict the market consistently, that is legit a TRILLION dollar skill.

I can turn $100 into $1T in a month if I had that skill. If a MACD chart was even right 55% of the time we would all be rich with zero effort.

The whole point of the market is to be as unpredictable as possible. Market makers literally find these ""predictabilities"" and work to eliminate them. 100 years ago the market was ""more predictable"", but with the current system these have been worked out to the point that unless you're a multi billion dollar fund with access to information that we don't have, you're left in the dust.

Please, do not trust any youtube channels or WSB posts that state ""this stock went up every time this happened"" or whatever.

I can pull up charts that show SPY goes up every time my grandmother farts. It's nothing other than a coincidence. You'll always be able to find things that trend alike, and at some point they'll stop doing so and you'll get burned, because in the end it was nothing but a coincidence.

I have started by trading bitcoin back in 2016, then weedstocks a bit after, and am now a full time trader/investor for the last 7 years. I don't like to see bullshit spread, but ultimately it will never stop and at this point has taken over. There's more BS then truth out there when researching.

Anyone reading this. Pull up that chart that the guy above screen shotted, and put in a fake buy and sell order every time that MACD crosses. You would have lost over all. Maybe a win here and a loss there, but keep doing it and you'll lose overall.

  
Please be aware I am not saying ""the market will not go down""....I am simply saying that MACD will tell you to sell AFTER you should have sold. If you sell when it tells you to sell, you could just be selling at the perfect time to buy, as it may just rebound from there. MACD DOES NOT predect the future and tell you what is about to happen, it only tells you what already happened. 

If you think ""it's telling you that a bearish trend is starting"", simple look up past examples and it will show you that you would have lost money if you traded based on that indicator.",,1711834393.0,kxb541r,False,t3_1brqony,t1_kxb129v,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1brqony/quick_question_if_everyone_is_bullish_this_week/kxb541r/,False,2.0,False,1brqony,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Lots of the major pharma companies with upcoming patent expirations and drug prices on the negotiation list have been making massive acquisitions. This means their strategy is essentially to artificially expand their pipeline prior to the expiration to ballon their offerings. For those within the industry, there’s massive budget scrutiny which may/may not play out for a stronger balance sheet. For the average American this has great benefit in the medium term due to our “silver tsunami” in terms of demographics.

All in all: I do think the industry will shift rapidly in the next 5 years and the glory days of pharma have changed massively.

They may be public institutions but many pharmaceutical companies will pay researchers to do research on their behalf (either directly or indirectly through putting up funding for PhD students) particularly with world leaders in various sectors of science. Scientific research is very expensive and now becoming more and more collaborative, this includes public/private partnerships such as universities/industry. The pharma company will pay for initial research (could be directly applicable or indirectly applicable research), use good results to come up with new potential drugs and then put those drugs through the very expensive and time consuming trials (on average 10 years and $1bn before a drug comes to market, patent limits are 20+5 years so 40% of a drug's patent life it won't make a penny). If the drug fails through trials, the pharma company is holding the bag for that, none of the public institutions are. 

Most universities would not be able to put up $1bn in risk and 10 years of effort for a single drug, whether that be in human resource, trial experience, physical resources (manufacturing technology, equipment), legal requirements (the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most strictly regulated markets and for good reason)...

For example I take an ADHD medication for children that is *almost* the same chemically as the adult variant (dexamphetamine vs lisdesxamphetamine), but it just works better for me. In a case like mine there’s literally no reason why a patient shouldn’t try both variants and see which one works best. However because the market for these meds is small the manufacturers just didn’t bother doing the testing to *prove* that the children’s version can actually be useful for treating adults,  it wouldn’t be worth the money, and as a result it takes some extra steps to be allowed to be prescribed these as an adult even though any doctor will probably tell you the two meds are functionally almost the same",,1711837186.0,kxbd236,False,t3_1bro25i,t1_kxawkpb,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bro25i/ozempic_maker_novo_nordisk_facing_pressure_as/kxbd236/,False,0.0,False,1bro25i,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

They may be public institutions but many pharmaceutical companies will pay researchers to do research on their behalf (either directly or indirectly through putting up funding for PhD students) particularly with world leaders in various sectors of science. Scientific research is very expensive and now becoming more and more collaborative, this includes public/private partnerships such as universities with industry. The pharma company will pay for initial research (could be directly applicable or indirectly applicable research), use good results to come up with new potential drugs and then put those drugs through the very expensive and time consuming trials (on average 10 years and $1bn before a drug comes to market, patent limits are 20+5 years so 40% of a drug's patent life it won't make a penny). If the drug fails through trials, the pharma company is holding the bag for that, none of the public institutions are. 

Most universities would not be able to put up $1bn in risk and 10 years of effort for a single drug, whether that be in human resource, trial experience, physical resources (manufacturing technology, equipment, pharma-quality tested drug materials), legal requirements (the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most strictly regulated markets and for good reason)...

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",moderator,False,kxbkvpw,False,t3_1bruulm,t3_1bruulm,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bruulm/can_sofi_really_dominate_banking_in_the_digital/kxbkvpw/,False,1.0,True,1bruulm,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

I realized I had no idea what options really were or how they worked. I just saw that some people got rich on options so I bought some. Over the years I’ve learned so much and now have a solid understanding. I know it sucks. I wouldn’t delete myself over this though. What’s the point. You made an error. Once you identify that error and other errors you can learn from them. Maybe you bought 0DTE options. Maybe you got too greedy. Just identify your mistakes and learn from them. Very educated people in the financial industry can turn 1000 into 1,000,000. It takes dedication, resilience and above all else; knowledge. Learn from this.

If you maintain these numbers for the entire year, you would achieve about a 22% return. That's not bad, considering the market moved sideways between May and June.

Further, the CCP is up their asshole constantly and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to manage export of these chips on Taiwan’s side, plus MAGA regards demanding import controls and tariffs to bring muh jobs back to the US that were never here to begin with.
