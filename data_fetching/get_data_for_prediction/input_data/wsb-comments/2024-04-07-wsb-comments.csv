Non farm payrolls are up year over year. Stop freaking out over headlines that tech firms are laying off a few hundred employees. 

&nbsp;

> home prices and rents are at record highs

The cost to rent is now cheaper than the cost to buy and the average Joe has benefitted more from home price appreciation than they have from stock market appreciation. 

&nbsp;

> relentless inflation in goods and services

Inflation is down significantly and much closer to the long term average of 3%. We’re probably not returning to our short lived <2% era of inflation. 

&nbsp;

> car insurance prices have gone up 30% in an year and now home insurance rates are skyrocketing or insurance companies are denying coverage!

Because they paid out more in claims than they took in for premiums last year. Weather-related claims are skyrocketing and people keep buying more expensive cars. Not to mention the average person is woefully underinsured for auto accident related medical coverage and most people have no umbrella coverage despite its cost effectiveness.

According to robinhoods simulate my returns, it says that a $443 call will be worth .02 at open and at $438 put will also be at .02 at open. Is that accurate? 

QQQ seems to move up or down $2.5 per day. If that is how much a $2.5 OTM contract is both ways, why not just buy both calls and puts and the only risk you have is it trades sideways that day?

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

Fairly common in auto insurance for wear items that are damaged in an auto claim, this same approach to claims is being explored in home owners.

The insurer has always owed to restore you to pre-loss condition. Obviously they can’t rebuild your 20 year old roof, so they reimburse you a new one. (Replacement Cost)

In the current scheme / way policies are written, they would pay upfront the Actual Cash Value of the damaged roof (depreciated amount), then when work is completed, the remaining amount is reimbursed - which sum of the two amounts would be defined as the replacement value (policy allowing).

Now, it’s pretty obvious the problem with this current system: The owner gets a new roof with no additional cost. He was returned to a better than pre-loss condition. Which leads to rampant exploitation and additional insurance costs that impact everyone. Currently, most state DOI’s insist home owners policies are written this way. (Replacement Cost).

However, with the focus now on home insurance costs going up due to catastrophes and the general inflation of goods and services, the DOI’s are being pushed revisiting ‘replacement cost’ requirements in the home owners policies to combat rising premiums.

Betterment, if allowed by the DOI when applied to say a roof - the insurance company would still owe for 100% the labor costs but would apply depreciation to the cost of materials depending on the age of the prior damaged roof. So, for example, if the damaged roof is 15 years into a roof that is expected to last 30 years, the insurance company would only pay 50% of the materials, while the home owner would pay the other 50% (plus any applicable deductible).

This approach I believe is far more sensible to raising rates across the board to underwrite claims where the home owners are effectively gaining value off their claim. Why this has not been the case all along is because in the eye of the doi’s -  premiums should directly reflect the insured item. Constantly adjusting a premium to reflect a depreciating component was seen as tedious if not impossible in the days of pen and paper so the premium was always based on replacement cost.  This was great until home owners started liberally utilizing their home owners policies at any occurrence in an attempt to replace their old roofs even for the most minor of damage. Claim occurrence data has reflected this trend for the last 10 years. With current technology, and quick data keeping / assessment, home owners insurance premium could be now ‘fine tuned’ to specifics of the insured items including wear and age.

All that is really needed are the state DOI’s to allow betterment be applied liberally to HO’s policies. Which, I believe will happen to combat the rising premium costs that have made headlines.

Ps- none of this has anything to do with insurance companies being greedy. In insurance, the best price for the same coverage always wins the business 99% of the time. This keeps it very competitive and lean between insurers. To put it into perspective: on average, for every $1.00 of premiums taken .97 cents is paid out on claims and admin costs. The 3% profit + float (money set aside for claims) is invested in the interim. Thats how insurance companies make money.

What this all has to do with is insurance companies pushing the DOI’s to allow for alternatives such as tailoring policies to reflect the age / wear of the insured items to raising premiums. This is the insurance companies advocating for the customer / public’s concerns about the ability to pay the HO insurance premiums if it continues to require replacement cost reimbursement.",,1712462102.0,kyf77rm,False,t3_1bxpfgj,t3_1bxpfgj,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxpfgj/insurance_companies_are_dumping_customers_in/kyf77rm/,False,1,False,1bxpfgj,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Claim occurrence data has reflected this trend for the last 10 years. With current technology, and quick data keeping / assessment, home owners insurance premium could be now ‘fine tuned’ to specifics of the insured items including wear and age.

All that is really needed are the state DOI’s to allow betterment be applied liberally to HO’s policies. Which, I believe will happen to combat the rising premium costs that have made headlines.

Ps- none of this has anything to do with insurance companies being greedy. Rates / Risks are regulated universally by the DOI. So what really matters to an insurer is obtaining the biggest insured pool as it usually means they can offer the best price for the same coverage (law of large numbers). Best Price always wins the customer’s business 99% of the time in insurance. This keeps it very competitive and lean between insurers. To put it into perspective: on average, for every $1.00 of premiums taken .97 cents is paid out on claims and admin costs. The 3% profit + float (money set aside for claims) is invested in the interim. Thats how insurance companies make money.

What this all has to do with is insurance companies pushing the DOI’s to allow for alternatives such as tailoring policies to reflect the age / wear of the insured items to raising premiums. This is the insurance companies advocating on behalf of the customers / public’s concerns about the ability to pay the required HO insurance premiums if it continues to reflect replacement cost reimbursement language by the DOI..",,1712462446.0,kyf77rm,False,t3_1bxpfgj,t3_1bxpfgj,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxpfgj/insurance_companies_are_dumping_customers_in/kyf77rm/,False,1,False,1bxpfgj,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-04-07 04:03:52+00:00,1712462632.0,Cursewtfownd,"I think you have a grave misunderstanding of insurance.

It is currently highly, highly regulated as is by the state DOI - That is why we’re in this issue of run away premiums. Insurance companies are looking for approval for ways to tailor policies opposed to raising premiums or canceling policies. 

See my prior reply on this thread:

This is nothing new to insurance, this has been an option for 30+ years. I’ll refer you to the term ‘Betterment’. Fairly common in auto insurance for wear items that are damaged in an auto claim, this same approach to claims is being explored in home owners.

The insurer has always owed to restore you to pre-loss condition. Obviously they can’t rebuild your 20 year old roof, so they reimburse you a new one. (Replacement Cost)

In the current scheme / way policies are written, they would pay upfront the Actual Cash Value of the damaged roof (depreciated amount), then when work is completed, the remaining amount is reimbursed - which sum of the two amounts would be defined as the replacement value (policy allowing).

Now, it’s pretty obvious the problem with this current system: The owner gets a new roof with no additional cost. He was returned to a better than pre-loss condition. Which leads to rampant exploitation and additional insurance costs that impact everyone. Currently, most state DOI’s insist home owners policies are written this way. (Replacement Cost).

However, with the focus now on home insurance costs going up due to catastrophes and the general inflation of goods and services, the DOI’s are being pushed revisiting ‘replacement cost’ requirements in the home owners policies to combat rising premiums.

Betterment, if allowed by the DOI when applied to say a roof - the insurance company would still owe for 100% the labor costs but would apply depreciation to the cost of materials depending on the age of the prior damaged roof. So, for example, if the damaged roof is 15 years into a roof that is expected to last 30 years, the insurance company would only pay 50% of the materials, while the home owner would pay the other 50% (plus any applicable deductible).

This approach I believe is far more sensible to raising rates across the board to underwrite claims where the home owners are effectively gaining value off their claim. Why this has not been the case all along is because in the eye of the doi’s -  premiums should directly reflect the insured item. Constantly adjusting a premium to reflect a depreciating component was seen as tedious if not impossible in the days of pen and paper so the premium was always based on replacement cost.  This was great until home owners started liberally utilizing their home owners policies at any occurrence in an attempt to replace their old roofs even for the most minor of damage. Claim occurrence data has reflected this trend for the last 10 years. With current technology, and quick data keeping / assessment, home owners insurance premium could be now ‘fine tuned’ to specifics of the insured items including wear and age.

All that is really needed are the state DOI’s to allow betterment be applied liberally to HO’s policies. Which, I believe will happen to combat the rising premium costs that have made headlines.

Ps- none of this has anything to do with insurance companies being greedy. Rates / Risks are regulated universally by the DOI. So what really matters to an insurer is obtaining the biggest insured pool as it usually means they can offer the best price for the same coverage (law of large numbers). Best Price always wins the customer’s business 99% of the time in insurance. This keeps it very competitive and lean between insurers. To put it into perspective: on average, for every $1.00 of premiums taken .97 cents is paid out on claims and admin costs. The 3% profit + float (money set aside for claims) is invested in the interim. Thats how insurance companies make money.

What this all has to do with is insurance companies pushing the DOI’s to allow for alternatives such as tailoring policies to reflect the age / wear of the insured items to raising premiums. This is the insurance companies advocating on behalf of the customers / public’s concerns about the ability to pay the required HO insurance premiums if it continues to reflect replacement cost reimbursement language by the DOI..",,False,kyf9xx0,False,t3_1bxpfgj,t1_kyehrf6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxpfgj/insurance_companies_are_dumping_customers_in/kyf9xx0/,False,1,False,1bxpfgj,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

I mean, for starters, that doesn’t even make sense in a highly competitive industry where price is the biggest driver of obtaining and retaining business.

Did you know every state as a department of insurance governed by the state? It’s because the state requires insurance for a variety of property / liabilities. 

Did you know every insurance company has to apply with them to be an admitted company to able to offer policies in the said state?

Did you know every insurance company has to justify their premium cost to the risks to the state?

Did you know any regional rate increases (non-individual) have to be first reviewed and approved by the DOI? The term is ‘taking rate’. This was and still is a huge issue in California after the wildfires. The DOI wasn’t allowing property insurers to take rate to the increased risks of wildfire. State Farm legitimately demonstrated that they would go bankrupt if the current wildfire trend continues and they were not allowed to take a rate increase to match the increased risk.

Do you realize Insurance Companies pay out .97 cents on claims and admin costs for every $1.00 they take in on average? That is a very fine line that they have to make a prediction on before they insure the  item- and remember the price of goods and services jumped nearly an unprecedented 10% in the last two years.

To answer your question regarding affordability / coverage that is not available on required insurance in your state by the admitted insurers (happens a lot with high risk drivers) : every state doi has in some form will only allow non-admitted insurers to offer policies as a secondary option for cases such as this.

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

It seems incredibly bullish. These guys can manufacture and charge such an insane price while the insurance companies don't even second guess the costs.

Edit tldr; Over 90% of type 2 diabetics are obese. And over 65% of type 1s are obese. Lilly manufactures the #1 weightloss drug named ""ozempic,"" which is in constant shortage at local pharmacies.

After it goes down, I think it will rise to above $1000 by the end of the year and go higher still going into 2025.

That being said, I will reiterate I do not think nvo is a bad bet whatsoever.

Edit: I found an article comparing the weightloss drug NVO has vs LLY. Here is my key takeaway (copy pasted) 

Unlike Novo Nordisk’s single-agonist drug compounds Liraglutide and Semaglutide which only work to affect one “hunger hormone,” e.g. the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Lilly’s new weight loss drugs are a new class of “dual-agonist” weight loss drugs, which act on two hormones: the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).

This dual combination may give Lilly an advantage in the marketplace. Clinical trials showed that adults taking these dual agonist class drugs from Lilly lost 21% of their body weight (when taking the highest dose) compared to 15% weight loss among adults taking Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy.

Lilly’s first entry in the market using this new dual-agonist mechanism was Trulicity, a daily injectable medication (with the active ingredient Dulaglutide) for use by type 2 diabetic patients.

Doing that every day, tradings in thousands of dollars just so you can make millions over a short period.... it's not worth it, and greed would get the better of you.

>It is a myth that the sun emits more dangerous ultraviolet light rays during an eclipse. In fact, the sun behaves as it always does, eclipse or no eclipse. The amount of invisible ultraviolet (UV) light rays remains the same, but the solar eclipse limits the amount of visible light coming down to Earth. When there is limited light, the iris expands the size of the pupil to allow more light into the eye to see. The damage occurs because the eye is fooled by the celestial phenomenon and allows a potentially dangerous amount of UV light into the eye, which has the very real capacity to damage the retina.

>A natural question then arises: if we are so sure about the S&P 500 going up in the long run, why not borrow money to invest in it? If we could borrow money on better terms than the S&P 500 returns, we’ll come out ahead. The idea of borrowing money, also known as using leverage, is probably as old as investing itself. Leverage allows us to amplify the returns on investment, but of course, any potential losses are amplified as well. Use of leverage is very common in real estate investing - why pay full price for a rental property when you can pay 20% down instead? Your potential returns are amplified 5-fold. 



> Of course, leveraged ETFs are active products with high expense ratios. UPRO has an expense ratio of 0.93, which is quite high compared to VOO at 0.03. The reason for such a high expense ratio is that leveraged ETFs incur significant fees from daily rebalancing and interest and transaction fees. But isn’t the expense ratio worth it if UPRO can triple the S&P 500’s performance? In fact, since stocks will almost certainly go up in 30, 20, or even 10 years, shouldn’t long-term investors all invest in a leveraged ETF instead?

>The answer is a resounding NO. Leveraged ETFs are designed for short-term trading. Due to a phenomenon called volatility decay, holding a leveraged ETF long-term can be very dangerous. This is the case even with a hypothetical “perfect” leveraged ETF which incurs no expense ratio and perfectly replicates 3x the index every day!

>Let’s look at a hypothetical index, the A Frugal Doctor (AFD) index, that starts at 1000. Over the next week of trading, the index posts small but consistent gains daily and ends the week at 1011. Let’s also have a hypothetical ETF, the triple-leveraged AFDx3, which perfectly amplifies every daily movement by 3x and ends the week at 1034. In this scenario, triple leveraging worked as expected. 

>More realistically, however, stocks are volatile and the index fluctuates from trading activity. It gains 3% one day and loses 7% the next, and so on. After a week of trading, the index still ends at 1011. Let’s see how AFDx3 performed compared to AFD itself under these circumstances. As you can see, although AFD ended up overall for the week, AFDx3 underperformed the index and ended in the red! The amplification of both gains and losses makes AFDx3 much more volatile than AFD itself, and can result in a sequence of returns where the index ends positive but the leveraged version does not. In fact, because any loss is so devastating when amplified, the leveraged ETF can only reliably beat the index if volatility was minimal, and even when it beats the index, it is unlikely to return 3x of the index itself. And remember that AFDx3 is a “perfect” triple leveraged ETF with no expenses! Also, consider the downside risk: if a normal index ends down 34%, you still have 66% of your portfolio value left for a future recovery. But a triple leveraged product will be wiped out completely.

Again, I don't think leveraged ETFs are bad and shouldn't be touched, I just think they are not a good pick for long-term large percentage of your portfolio.",,1712480981.0,kyg1w6t,False,t3_1bxwyxn,t1_kyfztby,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxwyxn/2_year_result_of_going_allin_on_tqqq/kyg1w6t/,False,15,False,1bxwyxn,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

> The reason, of course, is that the SQQQ is not designed to track the leveraged returns of the QQQ over a 3 day period. It is designed to track the leveraged returns of the QQQ over a daily period.
> 
> Why is that?
> 
> To put it in more technical term: The reason you can not create an ETF that tracks the leveraged returns of an index over any period longer than 1 day is because of margin requirements.
> 
> If you short the index yourself, and the index goes up, you have to put up more margin (or get a margin call). With an ETF, there is no way for the fund to require more margin from holders of the fund. That is, the fund manager has only the following options:
> 
> * ETF must hold cash
> 
> * ETF must close out all of its positions on a daily basis
> 
> Option 1 is too complicated - How much cash do you hold daily, do you hold more cash in times of high volatility, what if you run out of cash etc. Option 1 basically makes you an active fund manager, and the fees are very different for that.
> 
> That's why all leveraged ETFs go for option 2. They just track the leveraged daily returns of the index. And at the end of each day, they close their positions, and make sure that no matter what happens the next day, the ETF is able to track the -3x return of the index.
> 
> This type of mechanical buying/selling has 2 major side effects - High liquidity at the end of the day and volatility as a driver of volatility.
> 
> As you may have noticed, liquidity in the US equity market is always highest at the end of the day. In the last hour to the last 5 minutes of each trading day, trading liquidity is very high. The reason for this is because of the way the mechanical buying of all these ETFs works. At the end of the trading day, many of these ETFs are forced to buy/sell positions mechanically based on how the market has performed that day. They buy/sell based on their mandate, to prepare for the next trading day.
> 
> Since everyone in the market knows this, the smart traders save most of their biggest trades for the end of the day, when the big mechanical ETF buys/sells are triggered. This is why liquidity is so high at the end of the day.
> 
> Volatility drives volatility - Especially for leveraged ETFs, the more the market moves, the more they have to buy/sell at the end of the day.
> If the NASDAQ moves 1%, the SQQQ needs to buy/sell enough positions to offset a 3% move.
> If the NASDAQ moves 3%, the SQQQ must buy/sell enough positions to offset a 9% move.
> 
> Basically, the more the index moves, the more the leveraged ETFs need to buy/sell at the end of the day. This means that sometimes, when liquidity is very tight in the market, these leveraged ETFs will come and dump/buy big positions in the last 5 minutes of trading to further increase volatility.
>

Just say the index ends the day up 5% 5 days in a row but intraday on each of those days there was some pretty big swings, the leveraged ETF would have to rebalance its exposure daily. Because of the rebalancing and how compounding gains work (missing out on .5% here and there due to rebalancing) the losses can add up quickly. 

Constantly having to rebalance the leveraged ETF can add up to a lot of missed gains during times of volatility, other known as volatility decay.

It's commonly tested for at processing plants and if it arrives, the farm gets quarantined and out come the vets. It's perfectly fine in the meat when cooked properly and has always been harmless to humans anyway. It's still restricted when they find it though.

When the hog market tanked, I remembered hearing what happened (worked in a feed mill). No names given but it was cheaper to walk through the barn with guns and drop the hogs one at a time than keep feeding them until they're ""at shipping weight"".

This will be similar. They may let the virus run its course through cattle but they will restrict the milk. The issue will be how long it takes to go through the herd and they start producing clean milk again. If it takes too long, feeding the cattle will prove not to be worth it. 

Although milk is pasteurized, in the milk means ""in the workers"". Those at the plant, the milk truck going from farm to farm, the farmer to the grocery store, the kids at school....

It becomes a balance between taking the insurance payout if they ""drop the herd"", or continue feeding the cattle to later sell milk at a higher price. A small disruption or a long disruption will be the one that determines what happens.

If you truly believe Toyota and all the Chinese companies won’t have a fleet of EVs ready for America with self drive capability and Tesla will be the only car company left, you’re crazy. 

Furthermore, if FSD becomes viewed as a safety requirement, I expect regulators will step in and ensure that you’re not able to charge people thousands of dollars per year for it (or the insurance companies will fight it, because if FSD is truly as wonderful as claimed, there is no reason for them to exist). Additionally, I expect demand for the robotaxi will be low. Musk is not going to just let every random Model 3 or Y be turned into a taxi. He’s going to force you to buy the specific “robotaxi” model if you want to operate so he can squeeze $25-30k out of you.

2024-04-07 12:41:47+00:00,1712493707.0,No_Mathematician8622,"Occidental Petroleum is interesting. Beyond the Warren Buffett seal of approval they recently made two acquisitions of oil companies with mostly debt. They bought Anadarko in 2019 for 57 billion, 38 of which was debt and last fall agreed to buy crown rock for 12 billion, 9 of which was debt. That deal is expected to finalize some time in the second half of this year. 

All this debt makes them interesting because they are more sensitive to the rising oil prices. As the oil price rises all those oil wells they bought have been able to earn much higher profit margins that pay off the debt at a much faster rate.

This means that they quickly end up with a bunch more oil wells but get rid of the cost of the debt associated with those wells. Because of this they don’t just enjoy higher profits in the near term from higher prices, but have long term higher cash flows as they quickly pay down this debt. 

If you compare a company like chevron who has very little long term debt they still enjoy the higher oil prices for higher profits in the near term. But unless oil prices stay high will struggle to get the same long term value out of higher prices",,False,kygmya6,False,t3_1by30x3,t3_1by30x3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1by30x3/best_oil_stocks/kygmya6/,False,2,False,1by30x3,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

2024-04-07 13:03:34+00:00,1712495014.0,wallstreetbets-ModTeam,"Thanks for your submission! 

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

You lose weight because you don't feel like eating as much and that appetite comes back as soon as the drug wears off, meaning that if your habits don't change, you'll gain the weight back.

Anyone that manages to permanently lose weight from ozempic even after getting off the drug would've been able to lose that weight just as easily without it. Their achievement is a result of lifestyle changes, not a physiological change induced by ozempic.

This effect was highlighted by [the step 1 trial](https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14725) which does show a statistical improvement even after a year off the drug but also shows most of the lost weight gained back.

After a year off, everyone's metabolism was back to their initial point and the average net loss was 5.6% with a standard deviation of 8.9% over 2 years of trial (68 weeks of ozempic and 52 weeks off). This shows that the drug does seem to induce a psychological effect in patients, motivating them to lose weight but, with a SD of 8.9%, the best you can conclude is ""results may vary"".",,False,kygvb0p,False,t3_1bxwqlc,t1_kygpg5j,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxwqlc/lilly_calls/kygvb0p/,False,2,False,1bxwqlc,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

This proposal exceeds the Administration’s 2021 executive order which called for 50% EV sales by 2030.

Note the key word here. PROPOSED. Not even passed. 

It’s also an EPA RULE not a law. So you could quite literally change the rule with a new administration. Which we tend to get every 4-8 years. In fact there’s an election this year! Crazy. 

Again this is why you should actually do research bro. Bc you end up saying shit that isn’t even true and then you’re going to make actual investment decisions off it. Cringe.

Also none of this addresses the fact that RIVN is expected to make the same # of cars this year as last year. No growth. On a company that makes negative net income btw.

For the First Time in over 4 Months, there were No Israeli Troops in the City of Khan Yunis as well as the rest of the Southern Gaza Strip with the 98th “Ha-Esh” Paratroopers Division having Withdrawn from the Strip last night leaving only the 933rd “Nahal” Brigade as to Protect the Netzer Corridor between Central Gaza and the Sea; the Israel Defense Force has stated that this Withdrawal marks the Total Shift into “Phase 3” of the Gaza Operation meaning the End of any Major Ground Operations and the Establishment of a “Buffer Zone” between Gaza and Israel.

  
The likelihood that Iranian non-state proxies, particularly the entities associated with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI), will participate in the expected Iranian strikes high. There has been a recent shift in IRI targeting from U.S. bases and infrastructure in the local region to Israeli targets since the strike in Damascus. This could be interpreted as these non-state actors contributing to the wider Iranian response. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has commented that “resistance” elements will be part of Iran’s response. This statement further supports the assessment that non-state proxies will likely be involved in the retaliation.

Size and Scale of Iran’s Response: The time between Iran’s promise of a response and the implementation of said response is should be noted. Iran has signaled that Monday, two days from now, could mark the beginning of Iran’s response. The preparation phase appears to be significantly more time than past Iranian retaliatory strikes. Iran’s recent strikes on Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan are example other this.  
Given these factors, it is likely that the scale of Iran’s response will be larger than previous retaliatory actions. It is highly likely that the size of the force Iran is currently amassing to participate in strikes is larger than that of the readily available units and hardware used in the past.  The Behshad’s departure from its normal areas of operation is significant. In the past, Iran has taken the Behshad off-station to mitigate the risk of U.S. and Israeli retaliation against the vessel as a response to past Iranian strike.  Her apparent absence from the local region indicates with a high probability that Iran will conduct direct strikes inside of Israel. The certainty of a direct Iranian strike against U.S. bases and infrastructure is significantly less but still possible. Iran’s recent strikes on Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan could be interpreted as an indicator that Iran is preparing for a large-scale response.",,False,kygz8v6,False,t3_1bwri4i,t3_1bwri4i,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwri4i/weekend_discussion_thread_for_april_5_2024/kygz8v6/,False,5,False,1bwri4i,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Summary by [https://pi.ai/](https://pi.ai/)

The provided text discusses recent developments in the Middle East, focusing on Iran's response to Israeli strikes. Key points include:

1. Iran has transitioned to ""Phase 3"" of its Gaza operation, ending major ground operations and establishing a buffer zone between Gaza and Israel.
2. Iran's non-state proxies, such as entities associated with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI), are likely to participate in Iran's retaliatory strikes against Israel.
3. Iran's response is expected to be larger in scale than previous retaliatory actions, with a higher probability of direct strikes inside Israel.
4. The departure of Iran's Behshad vessel from its normal areas of operation could indicate an increased likelihood of direct strikes inside Israel.
5. Iran has vowed revenge for a recent Israeli strike on Damascus, which resulted in the deaths of elite Iranian generals.

Regional tensions between Iran and Israel are escalating and have the potential to draw the Middle East into a wider conflict.",,False,kyh0510,False,t3_1bwri4i,t1_kygz8v6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwri4i/weekend_discussion_thread_for_april_5_2024/kyh0510/,False,4,False,1bwri4i,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

Yes it’s true they doubled the amount of starter doses from February. But the demand is still waaaaaaay larger than novo supply chain can deliver. And that would not change for the coming years. 

About the new higher Rybelsus doses, (25mg and 50mg) novo has only applied FDA for T2D indication and not obesity. 

So novo will not be able to market an obesity pill for the coming years. 

But the 50mg dose tested in pure obesity trial gave the same weight loss as 2,4mg Wegovy.

Libya government was overthrown in the early 2010's by NATO (read USA) for deciding to no longer sell its oil in US Dollars, and to back its currency with Gold. This threatened the petrodollar at the time and the USA wasn't bogged down in Ukraine, Palestine, or Taiwan at the time.


A gold-backed currency is controversial because the country wouldn't need to participate in the US dollar dominated international financial system. If Zimbabwe could pull it off, it's more controversial than Russia invading Ukraine as far as rejecting US hegemony. Essentially they would be acting as an alternative to US debt which is something in the tens of trillions now. If countries don't use US dollars and debt to back their currencies then the USA collapses.


But it probably won't work because Zimbabwe would need to show its proven gold reserves, and then protect those proven gold reserves from a military that could get greedy and take over the building where the reserves are. Trust is most important when it comes to currency.

OPEX 23: 10.2B
REV 23: 5.4B
Shortfall: -4.8B

Now they’re retooling Normal plant, and going to increase capacity by 30%, while saving 2.2B. Lets say they produce the same amount of vehicles in 24:

OPEX 24: 8B
REV 24: 5.4B
Shortfall: -2.8B

Now ramp up the Normal plant 30% (or 100k if they’re doing real well in 2025):

OPEX 25: 8B 
REV 25: 7.6B
Shortfall: -0.4B

This is all hypothetical and speculation. Such is gambling in the grand casino. 

They have stated that they will have capacity of 200k maximum vehicle output from the Normal plant. If they can ramp up there as well, then they could potentially produce enough vehicles in 2025 to turn a net profit. They just need to prove it, and execute the numbers. 

Check my DD to see if there are pitfalls here, but the 2.2B savings should drastically improve margins. If they can make 100k vehicles in 2025, I see net profitability in 2026, unless they start building the Georgia plant. The Georgia plant doesn’t factor in to any of these numbers. RIVN is cash value now. If they can keep cash on hand by margin improvements, then we could see a bump in the P/E ratio and trade at a bit of a premium. But until they can show margin improvements, the stock price won’t run too hard or drop too low imho. We shall see. Earnings will be critical. Take what you will from this, but this is a 10 year hold minimum for me. If it dips, I’ll cap out at 1000 shares, set it and forget it. People have said they think the R2 could potentially be the greatest selling EV of all time. Shareholders sure hope so. It looks amazing.

Moreover, there are really NO sufficiently long term results that are considered definitive at this point. The entire field of GI hormone receptor drugs is still in its infancy.

To refuel an  ICE car, you *need* external infrastructure. If there's not a gas station within 300 miles, then it's completely pointless to own an ICE car. EVs can charge at any home that has electricity. In other words: any home. 

The vast majority of trips (something like 95% iirc) are under 50 miles so any range over 100 is overkill most of the time. In the rare scenarios where you do NEED external infrastructure (like ICE ALWAYS does) you only need to be within 200+ miles of a charger which is a milestone the charger network reached in that vast majority of the US years ago.  Also, charge times have been dropping since the first EV was made. 

I'm not saying oil is going to be wiped out completely (plastics and diesel are likely staying around forever), but consumer gas cars will be absolutely decimated by EVs in the near future.

A covered call is a call option that an owner of shares sells, using the shares he owns as the collateral.

**What is the primary benefit of a covered call?**

You earn immediate income from selling the call, and continue to hold the stock.

**What are some drawbacks of a covered call?**

* The premium collected is a short-term capital gain: it is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate for your income bracket (though the losses on other gambles you're making can offset this)
* If the stock is trading in the money (i.e. above the strike price) at expiry, you will lose out on the difference in profit you could have sold the stock at (e.g. if you write a $10 call and the stock is trading at $10.25 on expiry, you miss out on $0.25/share of the contract, because you will be forced to sell at $10/share)

**When should you use this strategy (i.e. ""why are covered calls good"")?**

Covered calls are only ""good"" relative to your ~~investing~~ gambling strategy.

You should use this strategy when:

* You own actual shares (not options) of a stock
* You believe the stock will trade relatively flat, or in any case will not rise above the strike at expiry
   * But be okay with selling at the strike price, i.e., okay taking a smaller profit than you'd otherwise have earned
* You want to generate income from the stock without selling it below a certain value (the strike)

You should **not** use this strategy if you expect to make a huge amount of money in income, unless you're already starting with a huge amount of money/a big portfolio.

Personally, I use a combination of long expiry calls and covered calls. For example, I own 10k shares of TLRY (avg $2.04/share), and I bought 25 $3 17 JAN 25 calls at $0.64. This is because I'm comfortable committing $20k of my money *now* for TLRY but think it will trade above $3.64 in January and would be willing to commit more capital then to exercise and either hold or liquidate and take my profit. I also sell weekly (relatively) far out of the money covered calls on TLRY to generate a small amount of income. I'm okay trading the risk of being forced to sell earlier than I otherwise would in exchange for that premium. I can always deploy that capital somewhere else or, if I desire, eat some of the profits gained from weekly premiums and re-up on TLRY.",,False,kyhob1j,False,t3_1bwri4i,t1_kyhjvbx,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwri4i/weekend_discussion_thread_for_april_5_2024/kyhob1j/,False,2,False,1bwri4i,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading.

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

The company is run by a guy that has become a laughing stock of the business world; a literal meme and not in an enviable way. Second, EV and their impact aren't quite like going from horse and buggy to automobiles; rather, it's like going from flip phones to smart phones, where both coexist for some time. Maybe that's a terrible way to establish a comparitive scale, but it's the best i could think of... because Nvidia's impact on the Ai revolution can't be overstated. Going from a world of Ai-enabled chatbots (LLMs, where we are today) to tomorrow's improvements in healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, education, customer service, defense, transportation, and advertising is going to change things in ways that are unpredictable, but it does not mean the change won't be powerful.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",moderator,False,kyhshpw,False,t3_1by998m,t3_1by998m,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1by998m/just_a_pizzaiollo_thats_spent_more_in_fees_than/kyhshpw/,False,1,True,1by998m,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

It’s not necessarily a new thing but the market is still confirming it is expected.  If there was any lack of conviction, the spread would be decreasing and the inversion reversing.

Basically the bond market is creating a Mexican standoff with the Fed.  If the Fed decides it does not want to cut, the rate spread would decrease, if not inverse again, which would potentially cause another run at the regional banks (as they would have to take writedowns on existing 10 yr bonds due to the lower yields they would be holding as new bonds would be higher), and mortgage rates would shoot up another 1% which would in turn raise PCE pushing the Fed further away from their goal.

Powell’s best move now is to keep applying rhetoric to control the markets while trying to build consensus.  So Kashkari can say whatever he wants - he’s not even voting this year, Powell has been toeing the line by explicitly repeating now that he expects cuts this year.  The market doesn’t care when, so long as it happens at some point.  If it doesn’t happen in June, the bond market may start to lose its conviction though.  Because the bond market has it priced in, the actual Fed rate doesn’t matter as much as the 10 yr benchmark rate is already down 1%.  Cutting the Fed rate won’t really move that much.  The first cut is purely symbolic from a rate perspective.

The only thing worse than getting bitched at for making cuts at during the last 90 days of an election year is causing a bank run at that same time.  The Fed is aware of unemployment, they know what the market has priced in, and Powell knows he can’t will the market to think any differently.  Goolsbee is on board, Mester is on board, Bostic I don’t think is far behind, Bowman is a lost cause (she didn’t even mention the second half of the Fed’s mandate - unemployment - when she ran her mouth), and Williams will come around when he gets bitched out by Dimon.  At this point Dimon I doubt wants or needs another gift from the Feds to absorb another bank.  Barkin is aware of the unemployment side though his view is hawkish - he is at least aware.  If his thesis is wrong, he’s an easy flip.  The others that vote fall in line with Powell pretty easily.

TLDR; the bond market has the rate cuts priced in, and if it doesn’t get it, the market is telling Powell you can kiss your soft landing goodbye.",,False,kyhtcpx,False,t3_1bx3i2p,t1_kyh0c3c,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bx3i2p/why_tf_did_kashkari_talk_about_interest_rate_in_a/kyhtcpx/,False,1,False,1bx3i2p,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Disagree, insofar as I personally know several big shots on the dealer and technology side of the industry who are completely out of touch with reality.

Some of them are old school so 30 years ago a run like this would have been shocking to them, still is, because they haven’t gotten up to speed with the more volatile times. Take Boeing for example, from 2000 to 2015, their stock increased from $44 to roughly $144. Nvidia rocketed past that in a matter of months. So the old guard analysts don’t know what to do with that other than scream they are going to crash and burn because they outran their actual value as a company, but have they? Boeing barely made any volatile moves until 2016.

Thanks for your submission!

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",moderator,False,kyi1mxv,False,t3_1byan08,t3_1byan08,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byan08/brics_to_use_gold_to_challenge_us_dollar_calls_on/kyi1mxv/,False,1,True,1byan08,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is >500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",moderator,False,kyip5cq,False,t3_1bydqmd,t1_kyioqkm,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bydqmd/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_april_8_2024/kyip5cq/,False,4,False,1bydqmd,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Former 737 mechanic here… back during Covid, all the airlines offered “early outs” to all the senior employees, so 2021/2022 rolls around, instead of A&P mechanic schools sending students to smaller regional airlines, ad hoc cargo, etc. brand new mechanics were going to major airlines. Before I left, I was half way up my airline’s seniority list and I had been there a year and a half, we had one guy who never even had to work night shift, when generally you are stuck on nights for at least 5+ years.

Said mechanics may have not developed their proper “work habits”, like triple checking for tools before closing cowlings, never leaving tools physically on a ledge on the airplane, doing a walk around of your area after cowling close-up to double check the cowling latches, which I’m 99% sure happened here. Happened at Alaska taking off out of Portland last year, except the cowling didn’t rip off until the pilots deployed the TRs.

These mistakes will continue to happen for awhile longer until all these new guys have their “come to Jesus” moment, gain experience, etc.

Sure, you could require inspector buy-back on every job… I’ve seen inspectors get burned for not properly double checking shit, it was a simple job, there were 36 valves to inspect and he picked 3 of ‘em, the adjustment of said valves is somewhat subjective… You’re dealing with humans. Complacency happens.

I doubt Boeing gets completely destroyed, the US is not just going to hand a monopoly on commercial aircraft to Airbus.


At the same time I think there could be more bleeding to come.  Boeing is still involved in heavily covering their collective asses and has yet to begin the management culture shift necessary to instill public confidence in their products.  When that does come it's going to come with lower margins because that's what they've been cutting to keep margins higher, quality.  


I expect them to get nocked again in the near future, so I wouldn't be looking for any short term turn around beyond a dead cat bounce.  If you're going long, I think there may be more attractive buying opportunities in the near future but I would guess you'd ultimately be fine to pick it up and give it time.",,False,kyis7mt,False,t3_1bycv9a,t1_kyilsj8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bycv9a/a_boeing_737_southwest_airlines_had_to_make_a/kyis7mt/,False,15,False,1bycv9a,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

To prevent terrible and illiquid companies from flooding our subreddit, we've instituted a minimum market cap threshold.

This threshold is $500MM and is automatically enforced by a bot. 

Sometimes however, it gets things wrong. If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.

The bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is >500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",moderator,False,kyj0by7,False,t3_1byfqub,t3_1byfqub,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byfqub/private_shares_on_the_public_market_spacex_open/kyj0by7/,False,1,True,1byfqub,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

The reason for this is to instill confidence in the currency. In an ideal situation no new currency would be printed without gold being added to the reserves. However governments tend not to follow the ideals.

1. Burger King had NO TRAFFIC WHATSOEVER. Maybe only ever a few cars parked at any given time and no drive through customers at all. Can't imagine it will ever do well as a company. Restaurant Brands is not a buy.

2. Starbucks always has a line of cars at any time of day to get coffee or whatever else. I wonder why the stock sucks because it seems like the volume of customers is there for sure at all hours of the day. What else is there to this beyond the issue of unionization? I wonder if SBUX has growth potential; a consideration to buy.

3. McDonald's always has a steady line of people in the drive-through and some people sit down to eat, especially older people. I went here and used an app and don't find it to be all that expensive given that McDonald's gives out many deals if you are using the app. However, something I noticed: the dollar menu has no dollar items. Even old people were using the kiosk and I think most traffic goes through an app, unlike other fast food places; McDonald's is on another level in terms of management and organization, as well.

So your basically getting the same IV for a larger bitcoin move.

Microstategy iv is like 130-150% and the options are way too expensive. 

Bitcoin miners are on average 90-120% and have a lot more affordable options. I understand the whole FUD.with them and I strongly feel the will likely crash post halving if bitcoin especially has a large drop, IE a 30-50% drop in bitcoin price would see miners do 70-90% drop from Curren prices.

The combination of Dilution and  excessively high post halving break even costs is contributing to a lack of performance in bitcoin miners.  

Current production costs on average are like 28k , and that's just to break even. When you factor in all the other expensive your in the mid 40s. And then after post halving it will basically double and you get the picture.

Markets are forward looking so that explains their under performance.

But in the very short term given the high bearish sentiment I would argue that miners would briefly out perform microstategy.",,False,kyj8ove,False,t3_1byeai0,t1_kyirwku,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byeai0/mstr_is_24_shorted_right_now/kyj8ove/,False,2,False,1byeai0,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

They are filling a niche within a niche. Most other, if not all, other EV car makers want you to replace your combustion powered car with an EV car.

This company E.GO isn't trying to market their car as something you should replace your combustion engine car with. They have marketed this car as a city EV car with about 150 miles of range. 

They realize that 95%+ people, 95%+ of the time, are doing in town/city commutes.

 So if you don't have to make big grocery hauls every day, then just driving around town to your normal spots or commute to work, this car can save you hundreds of dollars per week and 1000s in the long run on basic maintenance that you would spend on combustion car engines. 

And we all know the worst gas mileage is when you have to drive around in the city, and dare I say it, but for a city EV car, this thing looks cool and sporty as hell especially in this yellow color.

It's only $25k too. They haven't made their way to America yet, but when they do, you better believe they will be popular in big cities like New York and LA, the most densely populated areas in America. They currently have over 1000 cars on the road overseas. 

I think more Americans will gravitate toward this car, more than they did the Tesla because of how it's marketed. 

When people inquire about this car, they will know they're inquiring about a 2nd vehicle, not a vehicle that is trying to take you completely out of your combustion car. I'm no expert, it's just my subjective opinion.",,1712528735.0,kyj8x23,False,t3_1bydqmd,t1_kyj69pk,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bydqmd/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_april_8_2024/kyj8x23/,False,1,False,1bydqmd,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

But its still in the realm of small numbers and some of the incidents that show up there are just luck based.  Bird strikes show up there.  Turbulence that injures a passenger also falls into that category.

I can't really go further back because I have to do it by hand and most notably this doesn't account at all for flights the planes make.  I don't know for certain but I would bet that Southwest is using its 737-800s on more shorter haul flights than say Delta likely is.

But just looking at every incident the worst one by far was likely an American Airlines 737-800 that had brake maintenance improperly performed causing it to nearly end up off the runway at Dallas-Ft. Worth (and they have big runways although I am not sure if it was the somewhat shorter outermost one).  The next worst two were this incident and then a United Airlines 737 that lost a panel off the body in the air.",,False,kyj9fdn,False,t3_1bycv9a,t1_kyis0ib,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bycv9a/a_boeing_737_southwest_airlines_had_to_make_a/kyj9fdn/,False,3,False,1bycv9a,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

It notable that in this situation for example the pilots didn't know anything was wrong at all, it was only people in the passenger compartment who could see this issue.  In terms of the plane itself and flying it everything was reporting and acting normal to the pilots.

For example United had a 777 flying out of Hawaii nearly crash after takeoff that wasn't really reported in Dec. 2022.  The plane reached a low altitude of 748 feet after takeoff before things got in order.

And you are looking at the pilots needing to do perform 8 or so steps of the checklist correctly to get things oriented back to safe in about 15s or so.

If you were on the plane you likely didn't realize what was happening at all other than you would have felt the plane go nose down a bit, engines go to max, and flap position changing.  No radical maneuvering or anything like that.

I found out because I do follow some aviation channels and there is one where an airline pilot does try to recreate things in Microsoft Flight simulator in real time to show how tight these things can be pilots.  The video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDBhGPqPodo).

I want to see what happens. Besides the looks of this cool little sporty city EV, the way they have marketed the car, has made me want to buy and hold. I may be stupid for doing this, but they market the car as a 2nd vehicle.

Most other EV car makers want you to leave your combustion engines cars behind all together, and I think that's where the disconnect is for the majority of the population to go electric. 

This company realized that 98% of people 98% of the time are doing in town/in city commutes, so if you don't have to haul something big or make bug grocery hauls everyday, then this car can save you 100s of dollars per week and 1000s of dollars in the long run on combustion engine maintenance and repairs. 

Plus, we all know combustion cars get the worst gas mileage when driving in city limits. You can also take this car on the highway too. 150 miles is a good range for city commuting. 

Right now the car hasn't made its way to America yet, but when they do, you better believe they will be popular in big cities like LA, San Francisco, and New York, which are the most densely populated cities in America, and over half of them just happen to be tree hugging hippies who want to save the environment lol. So this car will be an instant hit in those cities. 

They have over 1000 cars on the road now in other counties, and they will only be $25k when they come to America. I'm not a professional investor. I'm just using a little common sense and the type of culture we live in today to make this bet. 😆",,False,kyjdzfp,False,t3_1bwuvcy,t1_kyjbzz8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwuvcy/tesla_stock_owners_when_will_you_sell/kyjdzfp/,False,1,False,1bwuvcy,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

In a broker's fever dream, a recession merges with stagflation, causing unemployment and bankruptcy to spike. Foreclosures and layoffs become rampant as austerity grips governments facing deficits and surging debt. A credit crunch leads to bailouts, plunging the market into a bear phase. Economic bubbles burst, companies downsize, and a downturn deepens into depression, triggering currency devaluation and defaults. Economic contraction couples with an equity market collapse, challenging fiscal policies as government debt balloons and insolvency spreads. Interest rates spiral, job cuts and liquidations are ubiquitous, and a market crash heralds a new era of monetary policy adjustments. Negative growth, overleveraging, and panic selling mark days; poverty, price drops, and quantitative easing define nights. The recessionary gap widens, risk aversion peaks, savings rates plummet, and securities sell-offs are ceaseless. Stagnation suffocates, stock market turmoil intensifies, the subprime crisis resurfaces, and tight credit constricts further. Toxic assets, a trade deficit, underemployment, volatility, wage freezes, and wealth erosion haunt every corner of this nightmarish landscape.

You certainly didn’t read and are actually regarded. 

You have no footing here because you ask for sources and don’t read them. Direct from the source: “Kim cites the $3,320 estimated cost for each H100 chip as coming from financial consulting firm Raymond James”

Also, you have no clue how a profit margin works. If you SELL banana for $10 and PRODUCE banana for $5, you have a 100% profit margin. 

Why the fuck would you multiply the profit margin by the sale price? 

Actual idiocy here. 

From the hopper vs Mi300x: my bad that I gave the generic chip vs the generic chip. H100 and Mi300 are similar base-level flagship chips. The Mi300x is specifically tuned for ai.

As an example I didn't see reported by a few months ago a Boeing 737 barely was able to stop on the runway after the brakes didn't perform properly.  The full investigation isn't concluded but they are pretty sure that American Airlines did something wrong when they were putting the brake lines back on and didn't change things to account for a different type of brake pad that they put on or something like that.  

There was a near crash with a United Airlines 777 in Dec 2022 that wasn't widely reported.  A combination of things occurred and the flaps weren't set correctly for takeoff on the plane due to an error on the part of the pilots.  When that was combined with low visibility the plane started to unknowingly descend on the pilots after takeoff and reached a low altitude of 750 feet before they got everything going correctly (although part of their procedure was to exchange altitude for airspeed).  Nothing at all in the reports that the NTSB did of the incident would have any fault on Boeing at all for it but if it had crashed the comments on a site like reddit would be all over Boeing even though nothing that happened on that flight couldn't have occurred on say an Airbus A350 or A330 (I don't know the model that United was using of the 777 so its hard to say what a good Airbus comparison plane would be).",,1712531935.0,kyjgy6o,False,t3_1bycv9a,t1_kyixyg8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bycv9a/a_boeing_737_southwest_airlines_had_to_make_a/kyjgy6o/,False,1,False,1bycv9a,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

But I also think that support is going to give management at BA lots of time to fuck around with every play before they finally get whipped hard enough, long enough to actually change their approach.  So yeah, I can see them going sideways or down for a long time yet.


But in the long run would I describe myself as bullish on BA?  Yeah, but only in the long run.  If I had to put a realistic timeline on a meaningful turnaround I would guess no less than 5 years, and that might be optimistic.  They're a large, bureaucratic organization and they need a complete cultural shift in the middle of a climate that generally dislikes persnickety engineering types that stress quality and safety over ""delivering value"" and ""iterative progress"" and other MBA fuckery where people who don't fucking know shit tell the mathematicians how to do their jobs.


But BA is basically too big too fail.  It's my expectation that with the runway they are likely to have they will figure it out, but it's going to be a long, painful process.  Honestly they need to be drilled into the fucking ground by regulators to bring home the point that cutting on quality and diligence in construction and engineering is a penny wise, pound foolish formula and that the only way for them to be successful and really make money is to develop a culture of rigour rather than quick cash when you make flying machines.",,False,kyjmnsb,False,t3_1bycv9a,t1_kyjdc45,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bycv9a/a_boeing_737_southwest_airlines_had_to_make_a/kyjmnsb/,False,4,False,1bycv9a,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else.
