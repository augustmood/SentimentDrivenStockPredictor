2024-04-06 01:15:18+00:00,1712366118.0,Organic-Pudding5372,"I think they will do somthing but I do also think it was priced like they would corner the autonomous driving market but that seems less likely by the day.   They way over promised on that front but we will see if they can get it fully to the commercial market.   


 Even still if ur assumption is that sales will increase then I would just like to point out that we are getting very close to the 8-10 year life expectancy of the batteries in those cars.   Since sales began to take off in 2017 soon u will see a flood of teslas in need of replacements.   These batteries make up the majority of the value of the vehicle.   As anyone that has ever bought a nice printer for 15 bucks that was out of ink knows you will see countless teslas that were totalled by battery repairs selling for very cheap.  


 We went thru this cycle with hybrids.   Some of the market for them remain obviously amd they have gotten so much better by doing more with less but the first wave of prius in need of batter replacements shocked everyone.   Initially estimated at 5k it ended up costing 10k or higher.   This affected the mostly speculative stock prices built around the new tech and it plummeted then evened out amd slowly rose since.     Same will happen to tesla is my bet.   (Unless elon has something up his sleeve)


  Cobalt is a rare commodity and continuously raising demand will send the prices of those batteries higher and higher.    This is part of why I do not believe the current class of ev is financially viable long term.   It will simply cost so much eventually that it will price most ppl out of the market which to me basically means they are nothing more than a luxury car manufacturer at that point.   Have a look at luxury car manufacturers market caps.  Hell look at any manufacturers market cap and then teslas.   U be the judge.   


Really though I do like tesla as a company and i do not want it to fail,  not that I believe it will.  Most of my fears with tesla is that the stock price assumes they will achieve somthing I believe is self defeating in its current state. 


  The price will adjust and find its place in the market but it will not be at 10x the value of Ford (f 53bil) as it sits now (tsla 525bil)and that's down from what over a trillion before?  For a car manufacturer?  Really?  That's just wacky in my idiotic opinion.   Just so many points of failure and relies on a adoption level impossible for this product.  I'll just leave it there.   




TLDR 


stock price is based on a adoption level that is impossible.   They will hit anyone of a long list of walls and it will bring the price down close to other car manufacturers.  


1. Car prices/battery repair costs will continuously rise.   mass adoption began 2017 battery life expectancy =7-10 years.  Battery replacements will total a vast amount of teslas.  



2.  Insurance policies for autonomous drivers is going to be nigh impossible to navigate for tesla as they will could be held liable for accidents.   


3.  Power required from the grid prohibits run away demand for the product as there simply is not enough power locally or nationally to sustain a population primarily using EVs.   


4.  Cobalt and other necessary materials were already rare before.   They will become so rare that it could killed the ev market for all but the rich.   




We shall see tho.  I'm a moron so if u think I'm wrong then ur probably right.   That's how I see it going tho.  ",,False,ky9doj2,False,t3_1bwwwnv,t3_1bwwwnv,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwwwnv/musk_is_trying_to_justify_cathywoods_2000_stock/ky9doj2/,False,5.0,False,1bwwwnv,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-04-06 01:38:37+00:00,1712367517.0,wallstreetbets-ModTeam,"Thanks for your submission! 

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

At a minimum, use the options profit calculator site to vet your trades, but the real advice is simple: if you have any money left on Monday, stick it in an index fund and forget about it.

Stopped trading and got busy in my full time job. I watched market every day though.

Started trading again with $270 in February 2024 and grew account to $1780 then lost $600 in a week cuz I broke my rules. Now climbing back up. Sitting at $1413.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)

I don't own Tesla shares and I don't really buy into the pitch but this is generally the Tesla pitch

The valuation is justified in the same way Apple's is, In 2007 if I told you Apple would become a $2T company from cell phones you'd laugh at me. All the manufacturers combined aren't worth anywhere near that! But what Apple did with the iPhone is create a new vehicle where software could be sold and then they collect what is essentially a tax on that software. Tesla is doing something very similar with cars. So even if they don't own the entire car market in the future car sales will become signifcantly more valuable due now also selling software. 

So the margin would be much higher then 3% but mainly due to selling stuff like self driving software which at scale would be near 100% profit.",,False,ky9ieq1,False,t3_1bwwwnv,t1_ky9fusf,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwwwnv/musk_is_trying_to_justify_cathywoods_2000_stock/ky9ieq1/,False,10.0,False,1bwwwnv,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

There is stuff that doesn’t make any sense, but the market is a pendulum and you lost the patience to see it.

Remember the Thursday afternoon dump? Well, Tesla was running high that day and barely suffered from it when other blue chip stocks got hammered. I actually had puts on TSLA rolling into Friday (granted 4/12 exp) because I usually play corrections a week out (1-2 DTE if SPY). 

Buying OTM Tesla calls was a terrible mistake because it was going to correct itself today. Doesn’t matter if the whole market was green, it was somewhat impervious Thursday (closed around $172). It wasn’t going to bounce back.

Something I learned on the MAG7 is they never all run in tandem. Weird shit happens where 6 of them drop and then GOOG or AAPL or TSLA decides to run, or vice versa. The market is singling out one or a few of these and they get hammed. I had TSLA puts and GOOG calls that both were profitable.

You did NVDA right, it was above $900 before Thursday PM and the market was going to correct quickly from that selloff. But the TSLA move into a significantly OTM SPY put….ouch. Unless Iran nukes Israel I can’t imagine that SPY will come close to $515 on Monday.

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

To keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! 

So we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:

* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.

* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. 

We want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).

This is what a great post looks like:

[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!

Here are examples of what could get your post removed:

* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.


Here are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:

* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.

* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else.

They benefitted from the bullshit of politicians saying they needed to push through the transition to BEV and….guess what….infrastructure and adoption won’t handle it. Car makers can’t do it profitably. Tesla gets hurt because they still aren’t considered to be a legit quality car manufacturer and they only produce BEV. When sentiment is down, they are down.

They benefitted from being the first to market and probably the only company who can actually do this at scale over decades. The failures of others hurt Tesla. Which is weird because it should be the opposite. The groundwork they’ve done is massive though. 

I honestly have no idea what a fair value of the company is though. I bought a decent position in the stock when it was trading $220-225 and sold before their last ER and am quite thankful I did. Playing options on them is honestly quite easy (I made money on trading both puts and calls on it today). Dumb luck but it is volatile and every time it goes high for no reason or vice versa I inverse with a close to ITM contract a week+ out and scalp 20-30% in less than a few hours.

I think Cathie Wood is a Elon Musk piss drinker and I think Elon is really never going to be taken seriously. He took a good social media empire private for who knows what reason and reduced the value of it significantly.

Certainly, here's the expanded summary:

ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) face concerns of being a potential bubble due to arbitrage opportunities with the NAV (Net Asset Value) price. Traders exploit price discrepancies between the ETF's market price and its NAV through arbitrage activities, which can lead to manipulation and unjust enrichment. This creates risks for investors, as their investments may be impacted by market distortions caused by arbitrage activities. Additionally, America's heavy reliance on ETFs for passive investing amplifies these concerns. The significant inflow of funds into ETFs exposes the market to greater vulnerability, as any disruptions or instability in ETF pricing could have widespread ramifications for investors. While regulatory oversight aims to mitigate these risks, the dependence on daily NAV reporting leaves room for exploitation, contributing to uncertainties about the long-term sustainability of ETFs as a primary investment vehicle.",,False,ky9v0gk,False,t3_1bx0xwl,t1_ky9txx6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bx0xwl/the_etf_bubble_we_hope_to_never_pop/ky9v0gk/,False,3.0,False,1bx0xwl,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Like AOL was charging $30 for dialup as broadband and other options were arising, way faster, and sometimes for cheaper. But they thought they couldn't die because they had a walled market that people liked. Blockbuster and Gamestop assumed people needed to go into store to buy and sell or rent games and movies, and that customers wouldn't go for digital games. Sure, they charged too much and paid employees garbage... but who wants to ""own"" a digital game instead of a boxed game and instruction manual?

Operating income (revenue minus operating expenses) allows a focus on operations. EBITDA also impairs comparability across major areas: rent vs. own, capitalize vs expensing software, etc.

John Malone, one of the greatest financial alchemists, created it to embellish the performance and the ultimate valuation of TCI… to be clear, it did have some validity in Malone’s very unique case as he refused to update the decrepit PPE before the sale to AT&T (so no maintenance capex) and with massive losses and NOLs, TCI paid little in taxes. In short, Malone added back what he needed for his goals—a higher valuation.

The rest of us use it as it allows us to embellish performance, control the narrative and it sounds sophisticated enough that others think we’re smarter than we are (similar to the illusion of precision). We can also reason with superficial arguments as most won’t think them through and they sound good enough on the surface (“non-cash” or useful life, etc.). This doesn’t change realities such as how a $1 of compensation expense is worth (at least) $1 whether initially wages payable or equity. 

Naturally, as embellishment is attractive to all of us, EBITDAs today ignore whatever expenses we don’t like. Uber’s EBITDA in its S-1 and then the subsequent near quarterly changes (adjusted, adjusted, adjusted EBITDA) is a great example of the collective delusion.",,False,ky9vvzq,False,t3_1bwof0q,t1_ky9sjex,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/ky9vvzq/,False,1.0,False,1bwof0q,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Why would the stock recover 38% so you break even? Why will the stock stop going down?

Indeed, if the stock recovered 38% in the foreseeable future, maybe you should hold?

It’s super common for people to refuse to lock in loses. They are painful. I’ve been there myself. But ask shareholders of numerous large cap stocks of the dot com era who said exactly what you’re saying now … many of those stocks never recovered or took decades to recover.

You do you, but don’t lull yourself into the idea that TSLA *has* to eventually recover 38% because it was once valued at that price.

Indeed, I can make the case that Tesla goes belly-up … and with all of Elon’s pivots (the latest being the robotaxi, but the last one I recall was trying to recast the entire company as an AI play) he seems to be all but admitting the fact that the company’s current product is dying on the vine.

Disclosure:  I don’t own an EV and, liberal as I am, cannot see me ever buying a *pure* EV in my lifetime.

I think the guidance and status on new fabs will be the price driving force with the ER.

Certainly, here are some potential fraudulent activities that could occur between NAV prices and market prices in ETF trading:

1. False Reporting of NAV: ETF issuers are responsible for calculating and reporting the NAV of their funds. There is a risk that an issuer could manipulate or falsify NAV calculations to deceive investors about the true value of the ETF's underlying assets. This could involve overstating the value of assets or understating liabilities to inflate the NAV and attract investors.

2. Front-Running: Front-running occurs when a trader or market participant executes trades based on advance knowledge of pending orders that will influence market prices. In the context of ETFs, this could involve traders exploiting knowledge of upcoming NAV calculations to buy or sell ETF shares ahead of changes in the market price, thereby profiting from the anticipated price movement.

3. Spoofing: Spoofing involves placing large, non-genuine orders to create a false impression of market demand or supply. In the case of ETFs, a trader could place fake buy or sell orders to manipulate the market price and create artificial price disparities between the ETF's market price and its NAV. This can deceive other market participants and potentially lead to unfair trading advantages.

4. Insider Trading: Insider trading involves trading securities based on material, non-public information. In the context of ETFs, insiders with access to confidential information about changes in the ETF's underlying assets or NAV calculations could exploit this information to profit from trading activities before the information becomes public knowledge.

5. NAV Manipulation: Traders could attempt to manipulate the NAV of an ETF by engaging in fraudulent trading activities in the underlying securities. For example, they could artificially inflate or deflate the value of specific assets held by the ETF to influence the NAV calculation and create price disparities between the NAV and market price.

These are just a few examples of potential fraudulent activities that could occur between NAV prices and market prices in ETF trading. Regulatory bodies and market surveillance mechanisms play a crucial role in detecting and preventing such activities to maintain the integrity and fairness of the ETF market.",,False,ky9y2jy,False,t3_1bx0xwl,t1_ky9w4aj,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bx0xwl/the_etf_bubble_we_hope_to_never_pop/ky9y2jy/,False,-1.0,False,1bx0xwl,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

2024-04-06 03:44:41+00:00,1712375081.0,Malamonga1,"Yes so for a high inflation cycle, typically after input prices spike, initially businesses eat those costs jnto margins first because they are reluctant to raise prices. Then after a while, consumers start accepting that high inflation is prevalent, then businesses raise prices. Then consumers start realizing wages aren't keeping up with inflation, they start asking for higher wages.

Now after the fed tries to fight inflation, input prices gradually drop. Businesses won't lower prices immediately because they will try to recoup losses they are up initially. After a while, consumers realize inflation is less high and start becoming more price conscious. As consumers become more price conscious, businesses start to increase prices less often. However, consumers will still demand a higher wage increase to catch up for inflation that already occurred. This is the period when consumers catch up to inflation. It will happen for a while and gradually wind down as businesses cannot eat up that cost forever. 

So in general, the wage catch up period happens after inflation already started dropping. With more unions in the past, consumers had more negotiating power and that period might have dragged out for longer, sometimes leading to wage inflation spiral. Without union, that period might be shorter, and I think consumers ultimately lose out after it's all over. So that helped the fed keep inflation down and not worth about wage inflation spiral, but at the cost of consumer spending power. 

That's why I think high inflation periods ultimately leave consumers worse off permanently. So it's important that when inflation first started spiking that consumers remain price conscious and shop for cheaper alternatives. Businesses will tend to always win out on pricing. But if consumers are price conscious and will shop for cheaper alternatives, that makes businesses think twice before raising prices, and to think of alternatives like globalization and other things to cut down costs before raising prices. This was the business mindset after 2008 recession.

But during covid, Americans didn't care and spent like no tomorrow. It didn't help that the fed and the gov ""normalized"" inflation and talked like the price increases were temporary due to supply shortage and chip shortage. That seemed to give consumers the false belief to just keep spending despite the outrageous sticker prices, because they think after the supply chain problem is over, prices will deflate back to 2019 level. This gave businesses the excuse to raise prices instead of finding ways to cut cost, since consumers accepted them.

 That's why in 2022 when the fed started fighting inflation and consumers becoming price sensitive again, many megacap companies started realizing they relied too much on price increases, had too much dead weight employees, and had to went on firing speeds to cut cost and focus on profitability instead of sales growth",,False,ky9y8vg,False,t3_1bwh3il,t1_ky9jerh,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwh3il/us_economy_adds_303000_jobs_unemployment_falls_to/ky9y8vg/,False,1.0,False,1bwh3il,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

Thank you for sharing this article. Here's a summary and evaluation:

Summary:
The author presents the idea that Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could be the next financial bubble. They highlight two main points: 1) ETFs can sell unlimited shares, and 2) ETFs report their Net Asset Value (NAV) only once at the end of each trading day. The author suggests that this leaves room for arbitrage by Wall Street traders who can exploit price discrepancies between the ETF's market price and its NAV throughout the day. They argue that Americans are passively investing billions into ETFs, trusting the daily NAV reported by the ""greed den filled with MIT and Harvard geniuses.""

Evaluation:
While the author raises some valid concerns about potential exploitation and manipulation in the ETF market, the article lacks depth and evidence to fully support the claims made.

1. The author's casual writing style, with phrases like ""TikTok riddled Americans"" and ""yummy daddy,"" detracts from the seriousness of the topic and may undermine their credibility.

2. The article does not provide concrete examples or data to illustrate the extent of the alleged arbitrage activities or their impact on investors.

3. The author acknowledges that regulatory bodies monitor ETF trading activities to ensure fairness and integrity, and that there are mechanisms in place to minimize price disparities. However, they do not explore these safeguards in detail.

4. The conclusions drawn are more speculative than substantive. The author suggests that passive investing is ""dumb"" and that there is room for fraud without providing a solid foundation for these claims.

5. The article does not discuss the benefits of ETFs, such as diversification and lower costs compared to actively managed funds, which have contributed to their popularity among investors.

In summary, while the author raises some interesting points about potential vulnerabilities in the ETF market, the article falls short of providing a comprehensive and well-supported argument. More research, data, and expert insights would be needed to fully evaluate the validity of the concerns raised.",,False,ky9ycm9,False,t3_1bx0xwl,t1_ky9txx6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bx0xwl/the_etf_bubble_we_hope_to_never_pop/ky9ycm9/,False,2.0,False,1bx0xwl,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

The whole reason that Uber/Lyft work so well in the first place is it dumps all the externalities and OPMAI expenses (insurance, gas, oil, engine busts, cleaning, wear-n-tear, tires, interest rates, etc) onto gig rubes who take out a predatory loan to buy a new black SUV to run it's asset value into the ground driving people around for $6/hour. The onus, down to every single penny, of opmai costs associated with ferrying people around is on the gigger, not the corporation.

This is *very* lucrative if you are the pimp in the equation, and a very bad deal if you're the one slinging the bussy. Uber/et. al. does not want to take on the expenses of storing, buying, cleaning puke, and maintaining a fleet of vehicles for $6/hr. Not only are these *massive* non-reducible expenditure overhead costs themselves, it also means hiring people to do those things that used to be done for *FREE*\*.

If I were on a Board of Directors and the CEO was like *hey shareholders, i'm going to increase our overhead costs by 90000000% with a continuous 500% y/o/y overhead increase, that cool with u?* I'd open the penthouse window on the 209th story and let them taste some fresh air.

Elon is gonna have to put back higher quality sensors if he wants to do this at any speed. But in a taxi fleet the margins can allow a middle ground between what WAYMO and Tesla are doing respectively. 

  
I think Tesla still needed to release a Ford Ranger and EV minivan more than a subcompact anyway. From an investing standpoint competing in lowest price vehicle market was never that attractive.  

I would be interested to see if a taxi fleet with higher quality sensors could improve the performance of ""dummy"" cars like the current Tesla fleet.

Amazon is squeezing third party sellers right now, and so on.

Yeah that ain't happening (even if it could). Those are still big expenses (both parties), Tesla now has to hire people to process and review claims, etc. And there's interest to increase rate of profits every quarter, which means cutting those things back over time until it's just a bad deal.

The other part is emotional labor and unpaid Dealing-With-It hours. Waking up to find your car wrecked and pissed in, even if you get reimbursed, is still toiling, and it takes you time to drive to dealers, file claims, deals with all that. And for what, $30 a night?

Granted, unrealized gains and losses don’t mean anything to normal people, only when realized, but what they are recording is the “change in value”. If they were to sell those shares at December 31, 2023, they would have gained value from when they purchased them.

I'd only seen the headlines about it before this, I had no idea it was trading at a 1700+ price to sales ratio. 

They compared it to Meta (9.40) and even Reddit (9.75) as more reasonable examples of healthy ratios.  

Of course, nothing can predict the power of the herd, but I think it's got nowhere to go but down and in a helluva hurry once the ball starts rolling.  

As both analysts in the video point out, something to watch for would be if the board approves insiders the ability to sell their locked-up shares early. 

If this happens, it's a pretty solid sign that they have no confidence in the stock and are grabbing as much cash as they can on the way out.

For 1099, the info probably gets submitted much later, and will reflect in the later revisions, but not counted in the initial release

The job report gets revised a lot, twice 2 months after initial release, and once more after a year after all the taxes are submittted

This is one of the reasons why it's hard for the fed to trust the data because it gets revised later, and the initial releases aren't always accurate.

This is more important during economic turning points because if the economy weakens, they need to respond quickly, but they need to wait a few months to confirm if the data is correct or just noise, and then gather more data to confirm their thesis.

Uber's take of the fare can vary from 25-40% nationwide but that doesn't matter in this case since there is no third-party arranging the pickup, it would be Tesla doing the customer acquisition.

This isn't like you go change or tweak an existing line, every generation is a new factory setup with new production line and all new equipment. They keep running the old equipment, they just add a new line. That's why older chips are cheaper, everyone has already paid for their equipment and can just keep making chips on it.

So if you are watching what a competitor has successfully accomplished, you are going to be able to copy them in 22 months, MINIMUM. 

They are already on the next generation when you are getting your equipment delivered and dialed in. 

Also the bulk of the income that pays for the expensive equipment is made in the first 2 years. When margins are very high. 2 years out, competitors come online and you cut your prices by 50%.

The difference is you're trying to hire people for a manual labor job. 54.7% of the workforce has earned a post-secondary degree in the USA by 2021. People went to school to get educated for the higher paying job. They will not go into manual labor, my back is going to give out in 20 years, job. It is not worth it. With the erosion of unions and even worse benefits provided by employers you will find it more difficult to fill these rolls.

The streets are quiet now. Not like the people are quiet like motor noise. In that there’s hardly any. With a combination of hard push’s from the gov and Chinese car companies making affordable EVs China has swapped to electric in an absurd short amount of time. Like sure getting a car there is still expensive for most ppl but with the combo of easy public transport, pay bikes , electric scooters and EVs cities just sound and smell totally different. 

But I guess that’s not going to happen here with nobody putting serious thought into public transport and affordable EVs off the table. Guess Elon’s idea is to milk the lower and middle class for all their worth cause he doesn’t think we need to own our own cars anymore.

they are ALL warning about shit sales and guiding down rest of the year. ANF almost went BK and then pivoted to not shit clothes with douche models. and some algo got ahold of it and squeezed shorts 

ANF is on a ticking time clock and will dump hard and fast. at around $50 a share it was on the expensive end. but there is no fucking way better managed companies like ULTA and LULU get hit hard and fast with retracting sales AND THEY HAVE CULT LIKE KAREN FOLLOWING and some douchebag company like ANF continues to grow

You can do that math and try and figure that out, but that’s ostensibly what the next quarters expected EPS is already speculating. 

I should’ve been more clear

I’m merely stating, ‘hey look in Q4, they beat EPS by huge margins, because of an non reoccurring item, and the market doesn’t seem reward them as if that was true organic growth’

Because it’s not and everyone knows that; and the reverse is also true.

As far as why this quarter would be .22, I think you’re asking why the estimate would seemingly wipe out the entirety of the gains seen in last quarter from the investments?

Well, few things imho:

First, I just through out .22 because that was what was offered in Hood app; there’s other estimates higher, eg .3, so it’s not gospel. Just making a point that the expectations do NOT show them at, eg., .7, when they just reported .66 last quarter, again because if what’s stated above. 

Second, you’re comparing QoQ, not YoY; as in, you’re now looking at 2023 Q4 vs Q1 2024, as opposed to Q1 2023, which would eliminate seasonal issues/differences. 

Could be other reasons.

Edit:

And also also, they could miss, stock can go down, I have no clue. I just don’t think this guys analysis makes much sense.

Alexa integration isn't needed to be done locally, the vast majority of processing is cloud based.  Temperature modulation is another thing that doesn't need to be constant, running a routine on a few minutes' timer will accomplish 99.9% of the job while saving a ton of effort.

What's even crazier is that Paulson gambled with the same junk derivatives that Lehman did at Goldman before he went to the Treasury, and because he did that he had to sell his $350 million in options and didn't have to pay any taxes on it. 2008 is such a gigantic mess, and today they are still gambling with the same credit derivatives that are worth ten times the world's GDP every day! When this bubble bursts (and it obviously will one day) no one will know who owes whom on the books and no amount of taxpayer money will be enough.

Now, if the price of Tesla is above 100 dollars at the end of the day, that’s not useful, right? You’d just sell your Tesla at the market rate, above 100 dollars, and OP and his contracts would be worth 0

And because the market didn’t expect Tesla to drop to below 100 dollars, because that situation seemed so improbable, those contracts were very cheap. OP bought 100 of them for only 500 dollars.

Then news about Tesla came out no one expected, and Tesla plummeted (fake numbers) to 50 dollars a share. Well, holy shit, now the ability to sell your Tesla shares at 100 dollars a share is very, VERY valuable! OP doesn’t actually own Tesla shares, so instead of using that option himself, he sold it for a massive profit.

Does that make sense? If the market knew Tesla news was being released that day, the options would have been much more expensive because there was a possibility for a massive downturn, but as far as everyone was concerned, it was a normal day, and the odds of a massive drop off were very low.

Encourage people to start providing their own goods and services to society rather than have abstract, useless corporate jobs. This opinion is coming from someone who is a Philosophy major in university right now. Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha will have to deal with the phasing out of jobs as we know it as AI takes over, granted this may take 20 years or more. My opinion: finance will be phased out and next to worthless, and we return to a barter-and-trade system of producing goods and providing services in the next 50 years. Every meaningful career will be taken over by AI by 2080 for sure, and that’s assuming that something beyond AI like a self-conscious AI isn’t developed, in which case humanity as we know it is finished. When AI takes over all careers, no more money will be left and the consumer ceases to exist. Even the top 1% will not survive it, money loses value without someone to purchase things.

Yeah if I was these folks I’d think the economy was doing ok, and occasionally you read online that the poors are complaining again. It’s not like they ever drive through those parts of town to see the reality, or even see those people face to face at their jobs. So what do they do? Keep pumping stocks, and to them why would they not? Since they own such a high percent of the wealth of the country, if they are buying stocks then stock market will go up. Only thing that scares these folks is if banks get in trouble, because that is an assault on their class and then they actually see the reality of what is happening all around.

Do they settle daily like futures contracts or are the more like options? I know Bill Ackman made a bag off of interest rate swaps that he purchased while interest rates were low.

You can now go to any AAA institution and buy a CDS to insure that $100 million against default. You pay, let's say, 5 million up front and then 1 million every year for five years.

 If Boeing defaults during that time, the insurer pays you $100 million. If Boeing's bonds are downgraded during that time, the CDS contract goes up in value and you can sell it for $10 million and $2 million a year. But the crazy thing is, you can insure debt that you don't actually own. You can just buy a $100 million CDS and bet that Boeing will default within 5 years. Then you get $100 million whether you own Boeing bonds or not. It's like 50 people insuring my house against fire.

r/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.

To keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. 

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",moderator,False,kye2vyc,False,t3_1bxmxy1,t3_1bxmxy1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxmxy1/scalping_options_on_spy_qqq/kye2vyc/,False,1.0,True,1bxmxy1,wallstreetbets,t5_2th52

We try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. 

This is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:

* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. ""What app should I use?"", ""What should I invest in?"". 

* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, ""inverse cramer"" joke again. 

* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. 

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers.

besides, he cant technically sell a covered call against stock he cant liquidate.  he would be selling naked calls with a margin that's backed by the calls which offsets his liability.

and _none_ of this matters because the risk the broker is taking is nullified by the stock he is holding.  if the stock goes up whole he is short it doesnt matter because eventually he will be able to cover with his stock.  if it goes down then he can buy on the open market and clear it.

the _only_ risk he would have would be the hard to carry borrow interest.

currently DJT is carring a 157.57% ctb.  that is the risk, assuming he doesnt jusf cover the shares on open market and sell covered calls again.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.
